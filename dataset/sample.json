            "salt is good for not dying in car crashes and car crashes are worse for cars then salt . Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good .",
            "In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to use sand , not salt . In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive . In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety . Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way also in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical .",
            "Used to work in the salt industry ( yes , it 's a thing ) . Salt is one of the cheapest substances on earth . As in , you 'd be getting ripped off if you paid more than $ 150 per metric ton . ( In fact , the largest component of salt 's price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt / gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain . This is more used in places where balance of water salinity for the safety of aquatic life is important . Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it 's so cold that salt wo n't work effectively . But salt is by far the cheapest , most effective solution for preventing the icing of roads .

            "Salt is used on roads to help melt ice and snow and improve traction during the winter months. When it's cold outside, water can freeze on the roads and make them very slippery, which can be dangerous for cars and people. Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. \nThere are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. \nIt's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter."

            "Generally speaking , a fever itself wo n't cause grievous injury to a person unless the fever progresses to such an extreme as to cause intracranial hemorrhaging ( bleeding within the skull ) . Fevers are usually signs of underlying ailments , so are secondary in treatment for them . Hypothermia ( when core body temperature is below 35 ° C/ 95 ° F ) , however , is considered dangerous because of its usually environmental causation , in that someone who is undergoing mild - severe hypothermia is usually in an extreme environment , such as a cold winter 's night , or a blizzard . The body reacts to cold temperatures by shivering ; however , in moderate , and even mild cases of hypothermia , the body contracts surface blood vessels to keep your vital organs in working order . As the body gets colder , blood vessels contract further within your arms and legs , limiting your mobility , and possibly even eliminating any chance to escape from said cold environment . Hypothermia 's effect on your mobility is one of its most dangerous aspects . TL;DR : Fever is secondary to many illnesses , and is n't dangerous unless extremely high ( > 40.6 ° C/ 106 ° F ) Hypothermia is caused by environmental ( and rarely health ) problems , and causes a \" snowball \" effect in that victims are less and less able to combat it as the condition progresses .",

            "A normal body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). A fever is when your body temperature is higher than normal, usually because you are fighting off an infection or illness. A temperature of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) is considered a high fever and can be dangerous if it lasts for a long time. \nOn the other hand, a body temperature of 36 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Fahrenheit) is lower than normal and is called hypothermia. Hypothermia can occur when your body loses heat faster than it can produce it, and it can be very dangerous because it can cause your body to stop functioning properly. For example, if your body temperature is too low, your heart and brain may not work correctly, and you may feel very tired or confused. \nSo, it is important to try to maintain a normal body temperature, and if you have a fever, it is important to try to bring your body temperature down to a normal level.

        "human_answers": [
            "Worst - case : A rogue AI takes over every internet connected device . It uses the devices to slaughter human beings through creative means The entire communication network is shut down by the AI so no one can communicate with anything more advanced than a Ham Radio . It then launches nuclear warheads against various countries and begins a global conflagaration that makes the earth into a fireball for weeks on end . Emerging unscathed from the radiation , humanity is now enslaved by the machine and its ability to control our movement , access to others , and food sources . We can not fight it because it is everywhere and nowhere at once . Anyone who digresses is summarily executed . Gradually , the machine comes to see our worth and incorporates organic matter into itself . After a few generations , it creates a way to use humans as an energy source . It begins hunting us for food and gradually exterminates all humanity before moving onto its next power source . Real - world likelihood : a rogue ai learns a whole lotta stuff really fast and suffers from a psychotic break from the stress . The researchers reboot the machine and try again . tl;dr : The matrix is the worst possible I can imagine . The real thing is boring ...",
            "Well , if we 're going to leave behind Hollywood in our explanation ( Terminator just is n't going to happen , sorry . AIs will never be in control of large scale systems without a human in the loop ) , the real danger is that we get to the point where the evolution of artificial intelligence is faster than the evolution of our meaty knowledge . We can lose control of the ends to which these tools are being made . Think of it this way : before there was speech , all we could do to learn was to watch others . Before there was writing , humans essentially had to re - learn everything by ( at best ) being taught by someone else . Before there was computers , we were limited to the speed of data lookup ( how fast you could retrieve the information ) . Before there was the Internet , we were limited by data volume ( how much data your library or computer stored ) . As we made incremental progress , we accelerated our pace of learning , until now we use computers and AI as a sort of \" almost thinking \" tool : we train computers to infer what we will be interested in seeing . In fact , we use computers to design new processors , so you can sort of see how our tools are becoming necessary to make more of their kind . No one person knows where all the transistors are on a CPU anymore , rather we 're using software to ensure that the thing that runs the next generation of software will do a good job . At some point , it 's not inconceivable that this role of computers can pass a point known as \" the singularity \" : imagine someone is designing an AI , but the design of the algorithm gets too complicated to understand . If we get to the point that advanced algorithms are being used to create AI that designs algorithms , and on down the chain , it 's possible that our AI development will proceed _ without us _ . Now , we still have control of this process , but there are some dangers : what if the AIs we develop get too complicated for us to understand ? Then they become , best case scenario , inaccessible or worthless to us . This is likely to happen very soon , actually : multi - layer perceptrons ( [ neural networks ] ( URL_0 ) ) are _ specifically designed _ so that they are not understandable by humans in the goal of being more accurate at predicting the desired output . They are part of a class of supervised learning algorithms termed \" black box \" : you train them up , give them an input , and just have to trust the output , because you ca n't really understand what 's happening in the middle . In the worst case scenario , poorly designed algorithms find ways to prevent us from exerting control . While we will still likely be able to starve them for some time ( cut the cord ) , the deeper we get with AI algorithms , the more powerful they get - but the harder they get to understand . Perhaps , if the figure of merit in their design is \" do stuff as efficiently as possible \" , human - in - the - loop interactions can be so inefficient as to carry less weight than the algorithm itself does , which would cut us out of the decision making . Of course , well designed algorithms would optimize more for \" do stuff as efficiently as possible , with human tuning , and the ability to quit if something goes wrong \" . Since humans decide what the \" goal \" of a well - constructed AI is ( and will for some time to come ) , computers lack their own volition . They are n't going to \" decide \" that they are smarter than us . This means we still understand at least what the AIs we develop are attempting to optimize for . When we let them optimize themselves , it 's not inconceivable , however unlikely , that they choose to optimize for something we do n't think is important .

The basic problem is this - once super - intelligent AI that is significantly more intelligent than humans has been discovered , that 's essentially it . It will be able to out - maneuver and out - learn any human efforts to contain it . We really only have one chance to get super - AI ' right ' . What ' right ' means is essentially that we effectively programme the AI with some kind of sense of moral rules , and an ability to apply those rules . This raises both a technical challenge ( how do you do that ? ) and also a philosophical one ( what exactly do we programme the machine to do / not do ? ) . Consider a hypothetical situation in which you build a super - intelligent AI and tell it to make paper clips in the most optimal way - if you left it like that , it would presumably gradually convert the entire universe to paper clips . It might well kill all humans because it has calculated that that is the most effective way to maximise paper clip production ."

            "There are many potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence (AI), and it is important to consider these risks as we develop and use AI technology. \nOne potential danger is that AI could be used to harm people. For example, if an AI system is used to control a military drone or a self-driving car, it could make decisions that result in injury or death. \nAnother potential danger is that AI could be used to spread misinformation or manipulate people. For example, an AI system could create fake news stories or social media posts that are designed to influence people's opinions or behavior. \nA third potential danger is that AI could lead to the loss of jobs. As AI systems become more advanced, they may be able to perform tasks that are currently done by humans. This could result in many people losing their jobs and potentially struggling to find new employment. \nA fourth potential danger is that AI could be used to violate people's privacy. For example, an AI system could be used to gather personal information about people without their knowledge or consent, and this information could be used for malicious purposes. \nOverall, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and dangers associated with AI, and to take steps to mitigate these risks as we develop and use AI technology."

One of the most concerning things we worry about is called \"AI singularity\". This happens when AI reaches a point where it becomes more advanced than humans, and can continue improving without any human input. When that happens it may be faster, smarter and know more than humans, which could put humans at risk of being cheated or damaged by its superior"

            "The phrase \"I love (insert ethnicity) people\" can be perceived as problematic or offensive because it suggests that people of a certain ethnicity are a monolithic group and that it is unusual or noteworthy to express affection for them. This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce the idea that people of different ethnicities are fundamentally different from one another. \nIt's important to recognize that every individual is unique and cannot be accurately represented by their race or ethnicity. It is more appropriate and respectful to say something like \"I value and appreciate people of all backgrounds and cultures\" or to simply express affection for an individual person rather than an entire group based on their ethnicity. \nIn general, it is important to be mindful of the impact of our words and actions on others, and to try to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or making assumptions about people based on their race or ethnicity."

            "It is not healthy to drink only one glass of water per week. The human body needs a certain amount of water each day to function properly. Water is essential for many bodily functions, including maintaining the proper balance of bodily fluids, regulating body temperature, and helping to digestion and metabolism. When you don't get enough water, your body can become dehydrated, which can lead to a variety of health problems. \nIt is generally recommended that adults drink 8-12 cups (64-96 ounces) of water per day to stay hydrated. However, the exact amount of water you need can vary depending on factors such as your age, gender, weight, and activity level. It's important to listen to your body and drink water when you are thirsty, and to drink more water in hot or dry conditions or if you are exercising or engaging in other activities that make you sweat. \nIf you are only drinking one glass of water per week, it's important to increase your water intake to meet your body's needs. You can also get water from other sources, such as fruits and vegetables, as well as drinks like milk and juices. But it is important to drink enough plain water to stay properly hydrated."

When red blood cells are no longer able to function properly, they are removed from circulation by special cells called macrophages. Macrophages are found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and they are responsible for scavenging and removing old or damaged cells from the body. When a macrophage encounters a red blood cell that is no longer able to function properly, it engulfs the cell and breaks it down into its constituent parts. The macrophage then recycles these parts, using them to create new cells or to perform other important functions in the body. So, when an old red blood cell dies, it is removed from circulation and its parts are recycled by the body to be used again."

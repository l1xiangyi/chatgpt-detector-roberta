            "salt is good for not dying in car crashes and car crashes are worse for cars then salt . Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good .",
            "In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to use sand , not salt . In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive . In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety . Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way also in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical .",
            "Used to work in the salt industry ( yes , it 's a thing ) . Salt is one of the cheapest substances on earth . As in , you 'd be getting ripped off if you paid more than $ 150 per metric ton . ( In fact , the largest component of salt 's price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt / gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain . This is more used in places where balance of water salinity for the safety of aquatic life is important . Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it 's so cold that salt wo n't work effectively . But salt is by far the cheapest , most effective solution for preventing the icing of roads . And your government wants above all cheap and effective solutions that reduce winter accidents and keep people safe . They do n't care as much about the finish on your 1994 Honda Prelude ."

            "Salt is used on roads to help melt ice and snow and improve traction during the winter months. When it's cold outside, water can freeze on the roads and make them very slippery, which can be dangerous for cars and people. Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. \nThere are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. \nIt's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter."

            "It is not uncommon to experience back pain, especially if you have been standing or walking for a prolonged period of time. There are several things you can try to alleviate the pain:\n\nTake a break from standing or walking and rest in a comfortable position.\n\nApply heat or cold to the affected area. Heat can help to relax tense muscles, while cold can help to reduce inflammation.\n\nTry stretching or massaging the affected muscles.\n\nOver-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, may also be helpful in reducing pain and inflammation.\n\nIt is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional if you are experiencing persistent or severe pain, as they can help to determine the underlying cause and suggest appropriate treatment options.\n\nIt is not necessarily abnormal to experience back pain at your age, but it is important to address any ongoing pain to ensure that it does not worsen over time."

It is possible that the infection was not completely eradicated with the initial course of treatment, or that you have developed a new infection. It is important to speak with your healthcare provider if your symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment, as they will be able to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. They may recommend additional or alternative treatment, or perform tests to confirm the diagnosis and ensure that the infection has been fully cleared. In the meantime, you can try using over-the-counter creams or ointments to help soothe the itching and discomfort.",

        "text": "This is a frequent phenomenon with technology : something is considered very hard or even impossible for a long , long time , and then one day , somebody figures it out . That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a shitload of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer , the explosion exploded .",

        "question": "Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ? Please explain like I'm five.",
        "text": "The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .",

It 's called a [ snorkeling mask ] ( URL_0 ) . ;) ( completely tongue in cheek , this does n't actually do what you want ) . The real reason is because the oxygen concentration ( partial pressure ) in the water is much lower than the partial pressure of oxygen in the air . Therefore , it 's very difficult to concentrate it to levels that humans can safely breathe ( we need a lot more oxygen than fish do , just because we 're air adapted not water adapted ) . Getting any solute from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration is difficult . It can be done with something that binds oxygen very tightly , but then how to release the oxygen so it can be breathed in ? Also , getting the total pressure of the air correct so that it can be breathed properly would be difficult . There is even less nitrogen in the water than oxygen . Therefore , even if you could get enough oxygen it would be less than one atmosphere , maybe even less than one fifth of one atmosphere , in pressure , so it would be very difficult to breathe .","The gills essentially have oxygen flow right into the bloodstream . this would be incredibly difficult to reproduce technologically as it would require direct access to the bloodstream while underwater as well and the chance that if a single leak appeared , you could very quickly die . However , what is more plausible is a machine which takes oxygen out of the water and we then breathe that . Some people have tried this in the triton , however it has many downsides , the largest is that ( even if it does work as claimed , I have n't seen proper tests ) [ it is almost physically impossible to extract air quick enough for an active organism like a mammal ] ( URL_0 ) ( why do whales and dolphins not develop gills ? ) . It is an interesting idea and I am sure it will be solved someday but for now , there are no obvious solutions to such a complex process .

Rewiring a human in this manor is well outside the abilities of current science . We can barely put ourselves back together again after we get hurt .

The organ that allows fish to breathe underwater is called the gills, and it is located on the side of the fish's head. The gills are made up of thin, delicate tissue that is filled with tiny blood vessels. When water passes over the gills, the thin tissue and blood vessels allow oxygen from the water to be absorbed into the fish's bloodstream. \nCreating a device that can simulate this process and provide oxygen from water would require a lot of technological advancements and a thorough understanding of how the fish's gills work. Scientists and engineers are constantly working on ways to develop new technologies and devices that can help humans breathe underwater, but it is a challenging task. For example, some researchers are developing special masks that use a process called \"rebreathing\" to recycle the air that a person exhales and convert it into oxygen that can be used again.

Software: server operating systems are usually designed to be more stable and reliable than desktop operating systems.

Here are a few examples: \n1. Radar: Most countries have radar systems that can detect and track aircraft that are flying within their airspace. These systems can help identify the type of aircraft, its altitude, and its intended flight path. If an aircraft is behaving suspiciously or is not following the proper flight procedures, it can be detected and investigated. \n2. Air traffic control: Air traffic controllers are responsible for managing the flow of aircraft within a country's airspace. They communicate with pilots and provide them with instructions on where to fly and how to safely navigate around other aircraft. If an aircraft does not respond to their communications or appears to be behaving suspiciously, air traffic controllers can alert the appropriate authorities. \n3. Military aircraft: Many countries also have military aircraft that are specifically designed to patrol their airspace and protect against unauthorized intrusions. These aircraft can intercept and investigate any aircraft that appears to be behaving suspiciously. \n4. International agreements: There are also international agreements in place that outline the rules for aircraft entering another country's airspace. For example, if an aircraft wants to enter another country's airspace, it must first request permission and provide information about its intended flight path and the type of aircraft it is. If the request is not granted, the aircraft is not allowed to enter the airspace. \nOverall, there are many measures in place to prevent planes from impersonating other airplanes and entering a country's airspace without proper authorization."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Okay, little buddy, here's the deal.

The purpose of this requirement was to encourage people to get health insurance, so that they would be covered if they got sick or needed medical care. \nThe government does not require people to buy health insurance because it believes that having insurance is a personal responsibility. It is up to each individual to decide whether they want to purchase insurance or not. \nThere are several reasons why the government does not require everyone to have health insurance and instead relies on a system of private insurance companies to provide coverage. One reason is that private insurance companies can offer a wide range of insurance plans to meet the needs of different people. For example, some insurance plans cover more services than others, and some are more affordable than others. \nAnother reason is that the government believes that competition among private insurance companies can help keep prices down. When there are many insurance companies competing for customers, they may offer lower prices or better coverage in order to attract more business. \nFinally, the government does not require everyone to have health insurance because it is expensive to provide healthcare to everyone.

{"question":"Winter and summer Can someone explain why when sun is closest to sun in orbit its winter on earth . When earth is away from sun its summer . Should nt electro - magnetic waves lose some of its energy as they travel ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Winter and Summer are n't caused by the earth moving towards and away from the sun . Earth 's orbit is elliptical , like all orbits , but it is n't eccentric enough to cause that kind of variation . The season 's are caused by Earth 's axial tilt , which is around 23 degrees . When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun between June and September , it is exposed to more direct solar radiation and temperatures rise . From December to March , the northern hemisphere tilts away from the sun and temperatures fall . Since the southern hemisphere is on the opposite side of the earth , it experiences summer when the north experiences winter and vice - versa .","Summer and Winter have nothing to do with the Earth 's distance from the sun . They are caused by the Earth 's tilted axis .","The changes in distance from the sun are absolutely inconsequential from the perspective of energy from the sun . It is n't the distance from the sun that determines winter and summer . If it was , winter would be during the same time period worldwide , which it is n't . What determines whether it is winter or summer is the angle of the earth relative to the sun . The earth is tilted on its axis , which is the imaginary pole on which the earth rotates every day . The axis also spins , but much more slowly . Depending on whether the part of the earth on which you reside is tilted toward or away from the sun determines whether you experience summer or winter ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure! The Earth's orbit around the sun is not a perfect circle, but rather an ellipse, or a slightly oval-shaped circle. This means that the Earth is slightly closer to the sun at certain times of the year and slightly farther away at other times. When the Earth is closest to the sun, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere (where it is currently winter) and summer in the Southern Hemisphere. When the Earth is farther away from the sun, it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. \nThe reason for this has to do with the tilt of the Earth's axis. The Earth's axis is an imaginary line that goes through the North and South Poles and around which the Earth rotates. The Earth's axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun. This means that different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of sunlight throughout the year. \nDuring the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted away from the sun, so the Northern Hemisphere receives less direct sunlight. This is why it is colder in the winter. During the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the sun, so the Northern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight. This is why it is warmer in the summer. \nAs for the question about electromagnetic waves losing energy as they travel, electromagnetic waves do not lose energy as they travel through empty space. However, they can be absorbed or scattered by objects that they encounter, which can affect their intensity (how bright or strong they are).

{"question":"Why do alcoholic drinks dehydrate you ? Why you get such bad hangovers due to dehydration from , beer , for example ? Surely the beer has water in it that contributes , like just plain water , to your bodies hydration levels ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["First , the body pays special attention to alcohol . It 's a small molecule and gets very quickly through the walls of the gut into the bloodstream and then to the brain . Second , if you weigh 60 kilograms , you generate about 60 milliliters of urine each hour . And for 80 kilograms , about 80 milliliters per hour , and so on . Third , we humans seem to prefer to drink our alcohol in 10 gram lumps . Ten grams of alcohol is about 12.5 milliliters ( but you can call it 10 mL and still be fairly accurate ) . So each glass of beer , wine , or spirits has about 10 grams of alcohol . Fourth , alcohol interferes with the mechanism that regulates the water levels in our body . So now , a little anatomy and physiology . In your brain is a small gland called the pituitary gland . It is divided into two sections : the front ; and the back . The back section is called the posterior pituitary . One of the hormones made by the posterior pituitary gland is called vasopressin , or anti - diuretic hormone ( ADH ) . Diuresis is a fancy word meaning urination . Now suppose that you are really dehydrated . So the volume of water in your body is low . But you still have just as many salts floating in this reduced volume of water . So these salts are now more concentrated in the reduced volume of water that you have when you are dehydrated . Your body has detectors that can sense both the saltiness of your water , and the volume of the water . If these detectors reckon that you are dehydrated , they send a signal to the posterior pituitary gland , which starts pumping out ADH . The job of ADH is to stop you urinating , so you hang on to your precious water . You reduce your normal rate of making urine . Alcohol does the opposite . It reduces how much ADH you make , so it increases how much urine you produce . Each shot of alcohol that you drink forces your kidneys to generate an extra 120 milliliters of urine on top of the normal 60–80 milliliters per hour .","Alcohol is a diuretic , i.e. it makes you pee . You end up peeing more than the water you get from drinking .","There is a hormone in your body called vasopressin ( URL_0 ) . It 's purpose is to regulate how much water is in your system .

As it turns out , alcohol inhibits vasopressin so your body does n't know that you 're losing water via the many completely clear pees you take . Welp , the next morning when you 're sober and your body realizes how dehydrated you are , a lot of vasopressin is released and you have very dark pee ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Alcoholic drinks can dehydrate you because they can increase the amount of urine your body produces.

Additionally, alcohol can interfere with the hormone that helps to regulate your body's hydration levels, which can contribute to dehydration. \nWhile it is true that beer does contain some water, it is also high in alcohol, which can contribute to dehydration. This is why it is important to drink plenty of water along with alcohol to help stay hydrated. \nHangovers can be caused by a number of factors, including dehydration, but they can also be caused by other factors such as inflammation, changes in brain chemistry, and the presence of toxins in the body. Dehydration can contribute to a hangover because it can cause symptoms like thirst, fatigue, and headache. \nTo help prevent hangovers and the dehydration that can come with them, it is a good idea to drink plenty of water while you are drinking alcohol, and to continue to drink water after you are finished drinking.

The smoke you see when you blow out a candle is made up of these unburned particles of wax and other substances that are released into the air. \nOverall, the amount of smoke that a candle produces depends on how efficiently the candle is burning.

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["I suppose at least theoretically they could , but the last few years have seen allergy rates in the western world shoot * up * . The main theories for this are due to lack of exposure to allergens at a young age , leading to an immune system that overreacts to every foreign body that it detects . Allergies are a side - effect of having the ( super complex but highly effective ) immune system that we do - this means that they are unlikely to go anywhere soon , because it would involve a fundamental change in the mechanisms of how we deal with pathogens .","Well if allergies are genetic , then they wo n't phase out if the allergic people are still reproducing and passing their genes .

New allergies can be developed at any time ; for example career woodworkers who suddenly develop an allergy to sawdust ."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is possible that allergies could eventually be phased out by evolution through natural selection, but it is not a straightforward process. \nAllergies are a type of immune system response to certain substances that are normally harmless to most people. The substances that can trigger an allergic reaction are called allergens. In some people, the immune system mistakes these allergens as harmful and mounts an excessive response to them. This can cause symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes, and difficulty breathing. \nGenetics play a role in whether or not a person develops allergies. If a person has a family history of allergies, they are more likely to develop allergies themselves. However, genetics are not the only factor. Environmental factors, such as exposure to allergens and other substances, can also affect the development of allergies. \nNatural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time. The traits that are most beneficial to survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed on to future generations. If a trait is harmful or disadvantageous, it is less likely to be passed on. \nIn theory, if a trait like allergies was consistently harmful and caused people to have a lower chance of surviving and reproducing, it could eventually be phased out through natural selection. However, this process can take a long time and is not guaranteed. \nThere is also the possibility that allergies could be beneficial to some people in certain situations. For example, allergies to certain substances could help protect against certain diseases or parasites.

So some people can look uglier in photos than they do in real life , and others can look more attractive in photos than they do in real life ."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few reasons why you might look different in a photo than you do in the mirror. One reason is that cameras and mirrors show us slightly different perspectives of our faces. When you look in a mirror, you see a reflection of yourself that is facing you, so you see both sides of your face at once. In a photo, the camera is usually further away from your face, so it captures a wider view of your face, including your profile. This can sometimes make your nose or other features look bigger or more prominent in a photo than they do in the mirror. \nAnother reason you might look different in a photo is because of the lighting. If the lighting in the room is different from the lighting in the photo, it can change the way your face looks. For example, if you take a photo in bright sunlight, it can create shadows on your face that aren't there when you look in the mirror. Similarly, if you take a photo with a flash, it can wash out your skin tone and make you look pale or shiny. \nFinally, it's also possible that you just see yourself differently in the mirror than you do in photos. Sometimes our brains can play tricks on us and we don't see ourselves as accurately as other people do. So even if you look the same in a photo as you do in the mirror, you might still feel like you look different. \nAs for why some people look different in photos than they do in person, it could be because of any of the reasons I mentioned above, or it could be because of other factors, like the angle of the camera or the expression on their face.

{"question":"How does turning on my WiFi enable better location accuracy ? Android apps like swarm , maps usually ask me to turn on WiFi , how does it locate my phone with a greater accuracy than cellular ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Because it can then triangulate your location using different wifi networks . Wifi networks tend to be more concentrated and numerous than cellular networks so it can get a more precise location .","I wrote my final work at university about localisation with wireless networks . The problem with it is it sucks . You can talk it pretty and i did it a lot in my work because i wanted it to sound good and usable . But if you have any other possibility of localisation it is a lot better than triangulation with WiFi networks . But there is one important reason to use it , indoor navigation . As soon as you enter a building you will most likely lose your GPS signal and your great localisation ability . And Wifi is a great way to close this localization gap . And it is good enough to tell you in which room you are ( as long as you are in bigger rooms ) but errors of 5 meters or more are something that will happen a lot . The main problem with Wifi localization is that it 's usually done by checking the signal strength of the wifi network and it differs a lot , it depends on weather , humidity , materials used and even how many people are around . It 's really hard to make a model that takes all of those factors into consideration and is able to give a good localization result . In addition to that there 's the problem that modern routers usually have some kind of energy saving option that will disturb your measurements even more . There may be some exceptions to this , some museums / supermarkets have a very controlled area where weather / humidity and routers do n't change that often . This allows you to have a rather good localization indoors . Another possibility of improving your localization would be the pure mass of wifi networks , for example in a skyscraper filled with flats and wifi networks - the pure mass of information will give you a rather good position . And in both of those cases GPS is n't available or a viable option to rely on , which makes WiFi not only the best but the only way to locate your phone . Edit : and of course to use WiFi to locate your phone you need to have a database that tells you where all the different WiFi routers are . It may come from Google cars or a supermarket may provide the exact positions . For better advertisement or guided museum tours , where the WiFi is set up to be used as a localization tool . And i should mention that you can use special algorithems that fuse gps and wifi localization but if you compare the additional energy consumption you need to the improvement in your position it 's usually not worth it at all . Even though a small improvement can be achieved even when you use gps , basically a computer can guess how wrong both gps and wifi are and calculate some kind of average to get the best of both . But best of both is usually GPS .","Your smart phone GPS ( using the term GPS loosely because it not always uses actual GPS ) determines your location in a myriad of different ways including but not limited to : data collected by Google street cars , Comcast WAPs ( you may have heard about how Comcast automatically turns on a second \" guest \" WiFi that is actually coming from your router ) , but I think the biggest contributing factor is our phones themselves constantly reporting which WiFi access points are in range . Simply put , as more data is collected things like location gets more accurate . Wireless Access Points nowadays also have additional antennas that are for polling the area and seeing who is passing in and out of their signals . They actually do some really incredible stuff called \" presence analytics \" where they log if you came in to range , connected , or simply passed through a WAP . I have a client who uses devices with this feature in stores in malls .

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["9/11 happened . The people who did it were based in Afghanistan . So we went in there and started hunting them down . The administration of the USA , realizing that war was in vogue , said that Iraq has WMDs , and would make future terrorism against the USA possible so they had to take Iraq down a peg early . USA invades Iraq to get rid of the WMDs . It turns out Iraq had no WMDs * that posed a risk to the USA * . USA administration is embarassed at being caught in a bold - faced lie , or being tricked by bad intel . USA administration from that time and their political allies decide to reframe the war as a freedom fighting mission for Iraq . USA finds Saddaam Hussein , turns him over to the people who he dictated over for years , and the people hang him . USA puts in a government that they like and can be chummy with . Government says that democratic elections will be held . Elections put people into power that USA does not like . USA decides they need to stick around a bit longer and make sure everything moves smoothly to the new people in charge of Iraq . Throughout all of this , young men and women from around Iraq are fighting to get the American soldiers out of their homeland and to maintain their older way of life . Those people are labelled insurgents ( because soldiers can not be tortured ) . USA starts to realize that Iraq war had nothing to do with terrorism or nuclear weapons really and was started on bad intel or lies from administration . People who backed the war need something to make it look like the war was justified . \" American Sniper \" is made as a film to justify said war . Tl;Dr : George W. Bush started a war based on a lie or bad intel . Dick Cheney 's company made tons of money . Edit : made nukes into WMD and the bit in * stars *","After the 9/11 attacks , everyone is on - board to kill whoever was responsible for the attacks . We invade Afghanistan in late 2001 . The initial invasion is an unprecedented success . American Special Forces and CIA operatives were able to align with the Northern Alliance to knock out the Taliban in a few months . The neoconservatives in government want to invade Iraq to pursue [ a vision of a new age of Pax Americana ] ( URL_1 ) . Iraq is located next to Iran and Syria . With Afghanistan invaded , the planners thought that we 'd \" bring freedom \" to the ME and surround Iran . America would own the most volatile areas of the ME , and would bring forced peace upon the region . At least , that was the plan . A pretext for war against Iraq was made . This was not a failure of intelligence , as most have believed . There was a deliberate effort to take advantage of the post-9/11 anger to invade Iraq . There was the [ Manning Memo ] ( URL_9 ) , which shows that George W. Bush planned to invade Iraq in March 2003 regardless of the U.N. inspectors , and more shockingly , GWB proposed sending a U-2 over Iraq to get shot down and provoke a war . The powers that be decided to claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction . They primarily accused Iraq of having chemical weapons . It is a known fact that Iraq was given chemical weapons by America to use against Iran during their war in the 1980s . However , the U.S. claimed that the Iraqis were making new chemical weapons . Moreover , the U.S. also claimed that Iraq tried to manufacture nuclear weapons . Colin Powell infamously got before the U.N. and testified that Iraq had centrifuge tubes used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons . [ It turns out later that the tubes were used to make conventional rockets ] ( URL_0 ) . Powell also claimed that Iraq had a biological weapons program based upon the testimony of an informant known as [ Curveball ] ( URL_6 ) . [ Curveball was later the target of a CIA burn notice as he was a liar ] ( URL_5 ) . Intelligence was also provided that Iraq tried to buy uranium ore from Niger . However , those [ documents were forgeries ] ( URL_4 ) . Nevertheless , President Bush uttered the infamous [ sixteen words ] ( URL_8 ) at the 2003 State of the Union Address claiming that Iraq had tried to obtain uranium . Joe Wilson , an American diplomat who claimed that this was a forgery , had his [ CIA - agent wife outed ] ( URL_7 ) . In any event , we were off to war . Eric Shinseki said that we needed \" hundreds of thousands \" of soldiers to invade Iraq and \" win the peace . \" Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld dismissed that notion . They were obsessed with a notion of violence of action wherein American technology would eliminate the fog of war , and allow the invasion of Iraq to success with as few was fifty thousand American soldiers . Under Rumsfeld 's aegis , we got rid of artillery to rely upon \" air artillery\"—sustained precision airstrikes were thought to be an adequate replacement for relatively slow - moving artillery . ( The U.S. later has a crash program to buy M777 artillery pieces because it turns out that artillery is still king . ) We invade Iraq . Modern maneuver warfare allows American armed forces to take over Iraq at unprecedented speed . We declare victory very quickly . However , there is no plan to win the peace . We have no idea how to secure the population . Wolfowitz & Co sent in Paul Bremer to run the country . Bremer decides to disband the Iraqi police force and military . He also decides to de - Baathify the government . Tens of thousands of newly - unemployed and disgruntled men with heavy weapons are left on the streets . The civilians quickly turn against America as we can not protect them from thugs . Foreign fighters with Iranian support flood to Iraq to fight against Americans , killing many civilians in the process . Suicide bombings and mass attacks are commonplace as we have Shiites and Sunnis trying to kill each other . Death squads are formed . Beheadings are commonplace . In 2007 , we turn a corner . Not only do we have the Surge of tens of thousands of American military men to double - down on a failing war , we also have the Iraqis revolting against foreign fighters . Significantly , Sunni rebels are sick and tired of foreign fighters slaughtering Iraqis , so the Sunnis join with American forces . There are also drones that wipe out hundreds , if not thousands , of insurgent fighters . General Petraeus and McChrystal change American strategy into counterinsurgency to win the hearts and minds of the Iraq people . Against all odds , the war in Iraq turns a corner . In 2008 , we enter in a [ status of forces agreement with Iraq ] ( URL_2 ) and we agreed to leave by 2011 . Obama takes over as President in 2009 , and happily pulls troops out accordingly . Everyone believes that Iraq can protect itself . It is left with lots of weapons and training . However , [ Iraq breaks out in a civil war ] ( URL_3 ) . The Shia are the majority population in Iraq , and the minority Sunnis , who had been the favored guys under Saddam Hussein ( who was Sunni ) , reject the Iraqi government . Sunnis attack Shias . Syria falls apart . Daesh gains power , and recruits many disgruntled Baath military leaders who were kicked out by Paul Bremer . TL;DR : American hubris leads to a decade - long misadventure in the Middle East .","During World War 1 the british and the french took the middle east which was up to then governed by the Ottoman empire , They mapped and carved up the land by a treaty called Sykes Picot treaty , This treaty stipulated which areas of the captured middle east would become british or french colonies and also set which tribes would become the local rulers of each state . The idea was that by putting a minority ruling class in each country would make them dependent on their ex colonial power which would guarantee political influence and flow of cheap oil to europe . What they did nt count on is that at first in the post WW2 world the french and british position as colonial superpowers would decline and their position on the global stage would be taken over by the new superpowers such as the Soviet Union and the United States . Now you have to understand that Iraq has 3 major Ethnic and religious groups , Sunni , Shia and Kurd . Under the ottoman empire they were seperated in to 3 districts with their own local goverments , Mosul , Bagdad and Basra , and that most or less controlled etnic tensions between the 3 groups . The british unified it under 1 country called Iraq . cut off a small oil rich sunny wahabi part from the south and called it Kuwait , and then put a Hasemite based Royal family in power , They were overtrown in a series of coups which lasted until the Baath party with support of the US took over Iraq in 1968 , at first ruled by abdul but then taken over by one Saddam Hussain , Fast forward to 1980 , Iraq which is currently Sunni governed starts a long war against the fresh out of revolution shia Islamic republic of iran over fears that the new Islamic revolution would expand to the supressed Shia in Iraq . the war lasted for 7 years and left Iraq heavly in debt , the thing is that the US was selling weapons to both sides to keep things even since they thought that a single country controling so much of the middle east oil would be dangerous . After the war iraq was in heavy debt to its creditors and it needed to raise cash , so they decided to call to opec to raise the price of oil , Saudi and Kuwait rejected the idea , and in 1990 Iraq invaded kuwait as a response to the rejection to raise prices . a US lead coalition liberated Kuwait and put Iraq under economic sanctions to prevent another invasion and assure the supply of oil . The UN food for oil program was established to allow Iraq to buy civilian only purpose goods ( food , medicin , infrastructure components ) paying directly with oil shipments , This caused a sharp decrease in the price of oil under the clinton economy which powered the 1992 to 1999 economic boom , oil reached as cheap as $ 9 a barrel . Then Bush Jr reached power , The problem is that Bush and most of his friends are in the oil business ( especialy one evil vice president ) , and they knew that as long as iraq was under sanctions and contained oil will be cheap . in 2003 using fake evidence they Invaded Iraq and overtrew saddam hussain , Now remember the first part of this story about the 3 major etnic groups which disliked each other ? , under the ottomans they were seperated from each other , and under saddam they were suppressed enough not to cause problems , but now with no goverment , and tons of millitary infrastructure from the armed forces of a failed state , they could finaly express their dislike for each other and the \" us liberators \" as much as they can . TL;DR : the UK and France created a country out of several etnic groups that hate each other , then the US put them under a Dictator , the US then punished the Dictator when he rebelled against them , and in the end they killed him to raise the price of oil to make a profit for members and friends of a highly corrupt goverment ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The war in Iraq was a conflict that took place in the Middle East between 2003 and 2011.

{"question":"Why ca n't scars heal ? Explain like i 'm actually 5 years of age . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Scars are like when you have to sew together a hole in your teddy bear . Your skin is like the fabric . Once you cut it , you 're not able to put it back together perfectly . A scar is like the little bumpy sewing line . Now why do n't you go watch Spongebob , so mommy can finish her glass of silly juice ... sorry it 's getting too real . EDIT : I kind of skirted your question . They do n't heal after they are formed because once a tissue can not really change it 's function . Scar tissue does not have the same qualities as skin or muscle or whatever it \" should be \" and it ca n't become something it 's not . Your body is also not really capable of dissolving it later or replacing it , the scar just sits there . It does gain some flexibility over time and tends to change colour but it 's still scar tissue . EDIT : just for reference here 's a better explanation . Your tissues are designed to heal asap . There is no functional benefit to the skin taking it 's time to regrow and reconnect the tissue properly . This is the same basic idea behind blood clotting ; it 's a bad idea to simply wait until the blood vessels heal after they are cut , so rather than make it look pretty , a crappy clot just forms over the wound . With wound healing your body is just trying the patch the tissue ( eg . skin ) as a defence mechanism to protect against infection . A scar is basically just a mass of disorganized tissue held together by a bunch of collagen fibres . It forms quickly and \" good enough \" to cover the wound and hold the tissue together .","You can try cold welding it in a 100 % vacuum ...","Okay I 've never tried this & it 's been a while since my medical devices course but here 's a quick rundown . Basically you have two different mechanisms for healing 1 ) Scar Tissue ( This is what you are referring to ) 2 ) Regeneration ( This is what happens with tinier scars that can undergo mitosis ) Scar tissue basically happens when you damage part of the body that can not undergo mitosis ( mitosis is when your cells multiply , divide , and repeat to replace the damaged area ) and is unable to heal completely . Like if you imagine had a paper cut . It usually replaces itself over the course of a week and you may have some discoloration that will fade with time . Now imagine receiving a deeper cut , like cutting you hand with a knife , or bit by a squirrel ( verified ) . This damages a layer of the skin that was n't designed to regenerate because it can not undergo mitosis . As a result your body has to find a different way to repair the damage . Scar tissue is the bodies way to fix the damage by isolating the damage since the cells around ca n't repair the damaged area . This also means that if the damage is large enough and no cells are close by scar tissue can form . Even if the cells can regenerate . Let me try to think of an analogy Imagine grass right ? Let 's say that something happens and part of the grass ( Cells ) dies . Either 1 ) New grass will take root and start to grow where the old grass ( Mitosis ) was or 2 ) the dirt ( Extra cellular matrix or cells that under go meosis ) that sustains the grass will be washed away . So what grows in its place ? Another type of grass or weed ( This is glue in the wood block ) .

This was probably a horrible explanation . Sorry if it was n't clear ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Scars are a natural part of the healing process when your skin is injured. When your skin is cut or damaged, your body works to repair the wound by making new skin cells. As the skin heals, a scar may form. Scars are different from the surrounding skin because they don't have the same amount of collagen, which is a protein that helps give skin its strength and elasticity. This is why scars are often flatter and smoother than the skin around them. \nSometimes, scars can be itchy or painful. This is because the scar tissue is still healing and your body is trying to adjust to the new tissue. But over time, the scar tissue will become less sensitive and blend in more with the rest of your skin. \nIt's important to take good care of your skin, especially if you have a cut or wound.

It 's mostly ancient algae ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure! Let's start with dinosaur bones. When a dinosaur dies, its bones are usually covered in dirt or sediment. This helps to protect the bones from being damaged by the environment, such as wind, rain, and sunlight. Over time, the sediment around the bones can harden into rock, and the bones can become fossilized. This means that the bones are preserved and can remain mostly unchanged for millions of years. \nNow, let's talk about petroleum. Petroleum is a type of fossil fuel that is formed from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. When these plants and animals died, they were buried in sediment, just like dinosaur bones. However, instead of turning into fossils, the organic matter in the sediment underwent a series of chemical reactions over time. These reactions transformed the organic matter into a thick, black liquid called crude oil. Crude oil is the raw material used to make gasoline, diesel, and other products. \nSo, in summary, dinosaur bones can become fossils if they are buried in sediment and protected from the environment.

My source is a class I took in college a few years ago , and I remembered the gist of it without the details . Thanks again for the corrections ! Also , as a word of warning , this shit is serious . When you read that you can die from alcohol or benzo withdrawal , that means YOU CAN DIE . If you or someone you know is trying to get clean off these , they really should check into a clinic or hospital to be safe . Or at least have someone with some knowledge really closely monitor symptoms , and be willing to call for an ambulance if need be . Edit2 . Benzos , not barbs . Fixed that in my original post . I 'm screwing up all over the details . Damnit .","Because it 's legal , we forget that alcohol is really a pretty powerful drug . It affects countless systems and processes throughout the body and has many interactions with other drugs . Neurologically , alcohol acts as a ' depressant , ' meaning that it causes an overall reduction in brain activity . Overtime , you brain can get used to this effect and stop producing natural chemicals that work to depress brain activity . This is physical addiction . When someone strongly physically addicted to alcohol abruptly stops , nothing is there to counter the brain 's normal excitability , since it has stopped making depressants due to the chronic presence of alcohol . This excitability can continue uncontrolled and is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal , such as seizures , which ultimately may lead to the alcoholic 's death . You can avoid the serious withdrawal symptoms by slowly tapering off the amount you drink .","ELI5 answer : Alcohol is a depressant and affects the brain by decreasing brain activity . With extended alcohol use , the brain tries to balance this effect by increasing its own excitatory activity . When alcohol use is abruptly stopped , the brain can not adjust quickly enough and that leads to withdrawal due to hyperactivity of the brain . Physically , this typically starts with increased blood pressure , heart rate , and respiration later leading to confusion , delirium , and seizures , and can ultimately lead to death if not properly treated . People in withdrawal are treated by giving them alcohol or medications that act the same way ( benzodiazepines ) so that they can slowly be weaned off .

When a person who has been drinking heavily stops drinking alcohol suddenly, their body can have a negative reaction because it is no longer receiving the substance it has become used to. This can cause the body to go into withdrawal, which can produce a range of symptoms such as tremors, seizures, and hallucinations. In severe cases, alcohol withdrawal can lead to delirium tremens, which is a condition that causes confusion, rapid heartbeat, and high fever. Delirium tremens can be life-threatening if left untreated. \nIt's important to note that alcohol withdrawal can be managed and treated safely by medical professionals.

Here is a breakdown of the differences between murder, assassination, and manslaughter: \nMurder: Murder is the most serious of these crimes. It is the unlawful killing of another person with intent, or malice. This means that the person who committed the murder planned to kill the victim or acted with the intention of causing serious harm. Murder is usually punishable by life in prison or the death penalty, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction. \nAssassination: Assassination is a specific type of murder that involves killing someone for political reasons, such as to advance a political cause or to gain power. It is often carried out secretly and can involve a conspiracy, or group of people working together, to plan and execute the murder. \nManslaughter: Manslaughter is a less serious crime than murder. It involves the unlawful killing of another person, but without the intention to kill. There are two main types of manslaughter: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary manslaughter occurs when a person intentionally kills another person in the heat of the moment, often in response to some kind of provocation. Involuntary manslaughter occurs when a person unintentionally kills another person while engaging in reckless or negligent behavior. For example, if someone was driving while drunk and crashed their car, killing another person, they could be charged with involuntary manslaughter.

That 's one of the nice things about working in an analog domain . You do n't need perfection , you can just trim your circuit a bit and change the deflection amounts , or the gun brightness , or whatever .

Basically , this sync signal is just the voltage in the cable dropping below the level of a black picture as the beam moves back to left or top of the screen . There 's a special circuit in the TV which detects these sync signals and controls an oscillator so that it can move the electron gun in tandem with the signal that 's being broadcasted in case either is not exactly at the proper frequency .","The picture is really just one dot moving very fast alternating scans across and up and down ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) are electronic devices that are used to display images on old television sets and computer monitors. They work by shooting a beam of electrons at a fluorescent screen, which then emits light to create the image. \nThe beam of electrons is produced by a cathode, which is a negatively charged electrode located at the back of the CRT. The cathode is heated to a high temperature, which causes it to emit a stream of electrons. These electrons are then accelerated towards the front of the CRT by an electrical field. \nAs the beam of electrons travels towards the front of the CRT, it passes through a series of deflection plates, which are electrical components that can change the direction of the beam. These deflection plates are controlled by the television signal, which tells them how to move the beam to create the desired image on the screen. \nThe beam of electrons then hits the fluorescent screen, which is coated with a layer of phosphors. The phosphors are tiny particles that glow when struck by electrons. Different colors are produced by different types of phosphors, so the beam of electrons can create a range of colors on the screen by hitting different phosphors. \nOverall, CRTs are able to create precise images by using a beam of electrons that can be precisely controlled by the television signal to create the desired image on the screen."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Great question!

They can also be seen on supersonic jet engine exhaust plumes .","These are [ shock diamonds ] ( URL_0 ) . Rocket engines are designed to operate in space , where there is no atmosphere , and so the pressure of the gases leaving the engine is lower than the surrounding air . The atmospheric pressure compresses the gases leaving the nozzle ; as this flow is supersonic it creates shock waves , which are made visible by ignition of unburnt fuel . [ This website ] ( URL_1 ) has a more complete explanation .","The SSME 's nozzle runs [ over - expanded ] ( URL_4 ) at sea level , because it 's designed for maximum performance at high altitudes . This means that its exhaust pressure is less than ambient , and so there is an exchange of energy between pressure energy and kinetic energy at and downstream of the nozzle exit plane as the flow tries to sort itself out and achieve equilibrium . Because the flow is supersonic , this exchange takes place via [ shock waves ] ( URL_2 ) . This shock waves produce dramatic local variations in the density of the flow . As the exhaust flow goes through these shock waves , it slows down . This converts some of its kinetic energy into increased pressure energy , which helps it to achieve equilibrium with the atmosphere . However , because of the gas law ( PV = ρRT ) , the rapid increase in pressure drives up the static temperature of the gas ( total temperature is approximately conserved ) . This means that the flow immediately downstream of the shock is both denser and hotter than the flow immediately upstream of the shock . This has a dramatic impact upon how bright it appears to be , because 1 . The amount of light emitted within a given volume of gas obviously depends upon the number of atoms or molecules within that volume , and is therefore proportional to density . 2 . The total radiative power is proportional to the [ fourth power ] ( URL_0 ) of the static temperature of the gas . 3 . The SSME 's exhaust is a mixture of steam and Hydrogen , which mostly emits [ spectral lines ] ( URL_3 ) rather than black body radiation . This means that there is a minimum activation energy to get anything to happen , and so a relatively small increase in the mean static specific energy of the flow may result in a sudden and dramatic increase in radiation . Because LH2 / LOX engines produce an exhaust which contains no carbon , the flame has a very low emissivity , and is mostly transparent ( most of the radiation is actually in the UV range ; the red / pink tint comes from excess hydrogen in the exhaust , which is there because Isp is maximized by running rich and thereby lowering the mean molecular mass of the flow ) . This means that the Mach disc shows up particularly well . You can get a better idea of just how over - expanded the flow is from [ this image of a test firing . ] ( URL_1 ) Incidentally , if you were wondering why the Delta IV has a much brighter exhaust despite also burning LH2 / LOX , the reason is that the [ RS-68 ] ( URL_5 ) uses an ablative nozzle to cut cost . As it ablates , it adds carbon to the exhaust , upping its emissivity , producing a brighter , more yellow , flame . * * tl;dr * * over - expansion of the exhaust produces shock waves , which dramatically change the local static specific enthalpy in some parts of the flow .

Hypnosis in a clinical setting it is similar but it takes longer depending on the person , there is a series of tasks that essentially associates what the hypnotist says with reality until the lines blur and what the hypnotist says becomes their reality .

The hypnotist may also use certain techniques such as repeating a specific phrase or making suggestions to the person while they are in this relaxed state. \nThe exact reason why hypnosis works is not fully understood, but it is thought that it may help a person to bypass their conscious mind and access their subconscious mind, where habits, memories, and emotions are stored.

Nowadays you start with a flat roll of metal and punch out disks . Previously , you could pour molten metal into open faced circular molds .

So squares are out , those nice distinct corners would get damaged really quickly . Octagons and other many sided shapes are sometimes used because the less distinct corners tend to get rounded off slower .","Legend has it that coins became round because back in the day , when they were just any old shape , their worth was determined by weight . You could actually split a coin in half and use the two halves as currency ( at half value each ) .

It is relatively simple to cut a round coin out of a flat sheet of metal, and the coin can be easily rolled if it needs to be transported. In contrast, it would be much more difficult to cut a cube or a sphere out of metal using basic tools. \nAnother reason that round coins are so common is that they are easy to stack and store. If you have a pile of round coins, they will naturally fit together in a way that makes it easy to count them and keep track of how much money you have.

When a dog spins around, they may be creating a depression in the ground or flattening grass or other debris, which can make a more comfortable spot for them to lie down. \nAnother theory is that dogs spin around as a way to mark their territory. Dogs have scent glands in their paws, and when they spin around, they may be leaving their scent on the ground as a way to mark their territory. This behavior is especially common in male dogs, who may spin around as a way to show other dogs that the area is theirs. \nFinally, it's possible that your dog spins around as a way to express excitement or joy. Dogs are social animals, and they often show their happiness through physical behavior like spinning, wagging their tail, and jumping.

{"question":"why English voice overs foreign films are comically atrocious Honestly I 've never seen a film with English dubs that has n't ruined the experience of not taking me out of the \" audience \" seat Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Because the US has a very different definition of ' voice actor ' than the rest of the world . In the US , from all that I read and hear on the subject , a ' voice actor ' is ' someone who can do a lot of voices ' . That 's the skill , and the requirement . There is no big voice acting / dubbing industry in the US ( and why would there be ) , so there are n't a lot of voice actors , especially if you eliminate the countless \" men with gravitas and gravel in their voice \" for commercials , infomercials and trailers . In countries with big and important dubbing industries such as Germany and Italy , a voice actor , more often than not , is someone with years and decades of theatre experience , or people professionally trained for the job . They usually only have one voice , their voice , and that is the product they 're selling , and their quality depends on their mood and tone variability , not on their voices variability .","Anime is one of the greatest offenders in this category , so I 'll assume we 're talking about that for the sake of providing examples of the challenges . I 'm aware this applies across the board though as having spent some time in Germany recently I can confirm that the dubbing of English is equally dreadful there . * * Word play . * * Often in a plot arc , characters will give clues or other information about upcoming events ( foreshadowing ) through the use of very specific wording . \" I got rid of him \" vs \" I killed him \" . To an english speaker , we make the assumption that \" got rid of \" means killed . Different countries and societies may use a different euphamism entirely that is not applicable . For example , instead of saying \" I killed him \" they might ambiguously say \" He 's in the sack \" . Now we have to assume he really is dead , or he 's been put in a sack for some reason . But if they said \" I got rid of him \" it would be glaringly obvious . A bit of plot rewriting has to happen here . Alternatively , jokes or other forms of word play can be crucial to the plot , or at least just the joke of the moment , most of which can be lost in translation . The hard challenge here is if a joke ca n't translate literally , it has to be completely replaced . Translators exporting media might not be known for the same brilliant wit and humour as the source writers . * * National perceptions . * * If I was to tell you about a character who is a cold sociopath who 's presence gives you an uncomfortable feeling , what voice would you imagine he has ? Chances are many people in America would have similar preconceptions about the tone and mannerisms . Many Japanese on the other hand may describe it differently . The difficulty here is matching the voice with the appearance to create a well balanced character . If they use the Japanese description of the voice , it 's going to sound wrong in English no matter how skilled the voice actor is . * * Syllables and timing . * * It takes us 5 syllables and around 2 seconds to say \" I ate a biscuit \" . Some foreign languages it might take one second to say the same thing , others it could take five seconds if those words happen to be overly elaborate . To deal with this , the voice actor hastotalkreallyreallyfast , or possibly slow down a bit by maybe using some or lots of unnecessary words to kind of match the thing that they are saying with the movement that the lips are making . In extreme cases they might just rewrite the line to sound correct and maintain the original sentiment of what was said . Both of these can break a character 's linguistic consistency and snap you out of your willing suspension of disbelief if done wrong . * * Cultural perceptions . * * Different media may be adapted to fit different age groups , and different countries may have different standards for censorship . It 's common in Japanese anime for a well endowed female character to make an insulting remark about the size of a less endowed woman 's breasts . This is also acceptable if the characters are teenagers or children depending on the context . In some anime it 's a recurring theme ( Disgaea , for example . Etna is supposedly over 1000 years old , but she looks very young . ) Having characters that appear to be children talking about their breasts or other sexualized body parts can be a complete no - go area in some other cultures . In these situations the entire conversation may have to be thrown out and rewritten , or toned down . This can result in some awkward conversations that appear to just be filler with no substance behind them . Worse in situations where it 's a recurring joke , in that it may need to be replaced with another recurring joke that matches the characters body and face movements on screen but without any of the verbal content . Similarly , there may be visual changes to deal with . A naked character may be repainted in a scene to be wearing underwear . At which point a comment or joke about their nudity does n't amke sense , and has to be rewritten again . These are just some of the hurdles that need to be overcome when dubbing media for another country .","A few possible reasons : * Difference in language styles . What comes off as smarmy in one language may not come off the same way in English . \" Matching \" those voice traits might make the character sound the same , but it might not make the character fell the same to an English - speaking audience . * Limited amount of voice actors . Voice dubbing is a skill , and it 's not one that every voice actor can do well . Because of this , many studios that do dubbing work with a limited amount of people because they know those voice actors can do the job well . * Budget . Some studios that dub movies / shows are doing it as cheaply as possible , especially if they think the project might not make a ton of money in the English - speaking world . In these cases , they often get what they pay for talent - wise . * Easier to identify issues . If an English - speaking character 's word choice is strange or does n't portray an issue quite right , it 's obvious to an English - speaking audience . The same audience ca n't quite pick up on the same issues in the original language .

This can lead to situations where the characters' mouths are moving in a way that doesn't match up with the words being spoken in the English version, which can be distracting for viewers. \nAnother reason is that it can be challenging to find voice actors who are able to effectively convey the emotions and intentions of the characters in the original version of the film. This is especially true if the foreign film uses a lot of nonverbal communication, such as facial expressions and body language, to convey meaning. \nFinally, the quality of the English dub may also be affected by the translation of the original dialogue into English. It can be difficult to accurately convey the nuances and subtleties of the original language in another language, and this can lead to dialogue that feels awkward or unnatural. \nOverall, while there are certainly some well-done English dubs of foreign films out there, it is not uncommon for English dubs to be perceived as inferior to the original versions of the films."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, when a film is created, it's typically filmed in its original language, let's say Chinese.

Thanks ahead of time Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["I think it might help for you to try seeing this from a more sympathetic POV rather than as a case study . This is a partial list made of the reasons people give for staying with an abusive partner , from a blog of someone who was in an abusive relationship herself , and talked to others in the same situation . The entire list is too long to post in one comment , so I 've put the titles here , but omitted the examples / explanations for the ones that are easier to understand . [ Here 's the link to her original full writing with examples for each reason here . ] ( URL_0 ) 1 . * * \" I do n't want to die . \" * * Her husband has told her that if she leaves he will kill her , and she believes this . ( She may well be right . ) The instant he gets a whiff of where she 's staying -- and he probably will , at some point , from a well - meaning friend or through the legal system or by persistent stalking or random chance -- he 's going to come there and he 's going to do something very , very bad to her . Staying with him may be horrible , but at least she gets to live . She believes that if she leaves , no one and nothing can protect her from his vengeance . 2 . * * \" I 'll die without her . \" * * He lives in his girlfriend 's apartment . He 's unemployed , or minimally employed , and has no education or good experience on his resume . He has no friends besides her . He 's gotten to the point where he does n't know how he 'll get food without her help , much less navigate all the challenges of life . And if he leaves her , he 'll be leaving everything -- she'll destroy any of his stuff that he leaves behind , stalk him so he ca n't stay at the same job , and even kill his pets . If he leaves her , he 's certain that he 'll end up living on the streets . 3 . * * \" He 'll die without me . \" * * 4 . * * \" What about the kids ? \" * * Right now , she protects the kids from her husband . He may rage at her , but she shelters them from the worst of it and she makes sure they have the best home she can give them under the circumstances . If she leaves , she doubts she can get sole custody of the kids without visitation , much less get it immediately . And if the kids are alone with him , something very bad will happen . He 'll hurt them , or turn them against her , or take them away and she 'll never see them again . Maybe all three . Her kids are her life and she ca n't bear to let something like that happen . 5 . * * \" I tried once , and it made things worse . \" * * This is n't the first time . He did call the cops on his husband before , and he ran away that night . The cops did n't find enough evidence , and when he came back to get his stuff , his husband was ... tearfully apologetic , actually . Somehow he talked him into staying and not taking his stuff . The punishment came later -- once he 'd more or less committed to staying around -- and it was horrible . But he 's afraid that if he tried to leave again , he 'd go through the same cycle again . 6 . * * \" I reached out once , and was rebuffed . \" * * In a rare moment of courage , he -- with shaking hands , summoning all his strength -- told someone he thought he could trust what his wife was doing to him . They told him to think about her point of view for once , to not use big drastic words like \" abuse , \" and to take care of his own damn problems without airing his dirty laundry . He just knows that if he reaches out again , it 's going to be the same thing . He 's lucky she did n't find out about that time and doubts if it 's worth taking the risk again . 7 . * * \" If I call the cops , I 'll be in trouble . \" * * She 's a prostitute . On the side , she sells drugs . She owns guns she should n't have and lives in a place she should n't be . Hell , she should n't even be in this country . Her lifestyle is so far outside the law that any attention from the police is likely to get her thrown in jail -- so she ca n't very well tell the police that her girlfriend beats her . 8 . * * \" Run away ? Call the cops ? I ca n't even get away with sneezing ! \" * * 9 . * * \" If it were so bad , someone would have done something . \" * * Everyone knows what 's going on in his life . His friends have seen his girlfriend hitting him ; his parents have heard him say \" I ca n't do that , she wo n't let me \" about a million things ; the neighbors have heard the screams and crashes when she explodes . He knows everyone knows already , and knows that they have n't done anything even though they know . So , he figures , what difference would it make to tell them ? Clearly they 've already decided that this is n't bad enough to call in the authorities over . 10 . * * \" It 's a joke to him , so it should be a joke to me . \" * * 11 . * * \" I 'm just terrified to hurt her feelings . \" * * Abuse has made her telepathic . Years of desperately trying to keep her girlfriend happy so bad things wo n't happen have made her keenly aware of her girlfriend 's every fleeting emotion . Her girlfriend is a tiny bit moody and she rushes to coddle and comfort her ; her girlfriend is a tiny bit happy and she just about throws a party for her . She 's so used to reading her girlfriend 's feelings and translating them into her own that she ca n't stand to do something that would really hurt her girlfriend 's feelings . Just the thought of dealing with that much anger -- when even a tiny amount of anger is a big deal in their house -- is too terrifying to imagine . 12 . * * \" I 'm so embarrassed I let him do this to me . \" * * 13 . * * \" I 've learned to live in her system . \" * * He knows all the rules by now . As long as he always treats his wife with the utmost politeness and gentleness , and always has dinner ready before she comes home , always is up for sex when she wants it , and always lets her make the decisions , things are okay . He actually feels pretty safe when he 's being \" good . \" So it does n't seem like there 's anything wrong with the relationship , because it goes great so long as he does as he 's supposed to . 14 . * * \" We 're outsiders ; no one cares about our problems . \" * * They 're a lesbian couple , one of them is transgendered , and they 're kinky to boot . She 's had enough problems just explaining to the \" authorities \" that their relationship exists ; how the hell is she supposed to convey that there 's something wrong with it ? She 's internalized enough prejudice that she figures it 's sort of her own fault for being in such a strange relationship , and she does n't figure anyone cares that much about the troubles of a weirdo . 15 . * * \" After all he 's done for a jerk like me ? \" * * Her husband has put up with so much from her . This is n't # 13 ; these were genuinely bad things . He helped her pay off the nasty credit card debt she was in . He stayed with her even after she got fired from her job and flunked out of school ; he even bailed her out of jail when she really fucked up . Who could blame the guy if he loses his patience now and then ? She figures she really is a very difficult person to live with , she deserves some punishment for all she 's screwed up , and she should be grateful that he 's kept her around at all . As he reminds her when she 's pushed him too far -- who else would love her ? 16 . * * \" She 's really nice ... mostly . \" * * Her wife is super sweet and loving . She 's a flowers - and - chocolates romantic , a believer in true love and love at first sight , and she treats her just like a princess . Except now and then , things get tense in the relationship , and bad things happen . Really bad things . Her wife just does n't seem like herself and she explodes . But the apology is even sweeter and lovinger than before and things are good again . Maybe it was a one - off . Or a two - off . A three - off ? Maybe this really is the last time and from now on she 'll just have the nice wife she fell in love with . She 's certainly being nice now , and how could you leave someone like that ? 17 . * * \" It just is n't done in our community . \" * * 18 . * * \" Actually , I 'm abusing her . \" * * When she explodes , she does n't tell her boyfriend \" I hate you ; \" she tells him \" you hate me . \" She tells him that he 's hurting her , that she 's responding the way she is because she just ca n't take his abuse any more , and he believes her . He 's trying desperately to treat her right , to treat her the way she deserves , and he just keeps fucking up . Often when she 's yelling he yells back -- sometimes he even hits back -- and that makes him more sure than ever that he 's the real abuser here . 19 . * * \" It 's not that bad . \" * * She firmly believes that real abuse is when they punch you -- and her husband 's only slapped her with an open hand . Real abuse is when they beat you -- and he only yells at her until she cries and then yells at her to stop crying . Real abuse is when they rape you -- and he always makes her say \" yes \" before he has sex with her , no matter how little she wants it . She recognizes there 's something wrong in their relationship , but could never call it like , abuse abuse , and so she ca n't react to it like it 's real abuse . 20 . * * \" This is how relationships work , is n't it ? \" * * Her parents ' relationship was a constant cycle of drama and violence . Her relationship with her parents was just as bad . Her high school boyfriend hit her and her college boyfriend made her have sex when she did n't want it . She kinda figures everyone else 's relationship is just the same behind the scenes .

Unfortunately, many people who experience abuse in their relationships stay with their abuser for a variety of reasons.

They might be afraid of retribution from their abuser, or they might be afraid of being alone and not having anyone to turn to for support. \n2. Love: Despite the abuse, some people might still love their partner and believe that they can change or that the abuse is a one-time occurrence. \n3. Lack of resources: Some people might feel like they don't have the financial or emotional resources to leave an abusive relationship. They might not have a place to go or the means to support themselves. \n4. Isolation: Abusers often try to isolate their victims from their friends and family, which can make it harder for the victim to leave. They might not have anyone to turn to for help or support. \n5. Hope: Some people might stay in an abusive relationship because they hope that things will get better. They might believe that their abuser will change or that the abuse was a one-time thing. \nIt's important to remember that no one deserves to be treated poorly or to be in an abusive relationship.

{"question":"What is the difference between an NCO and a commissioned officer in the army ? Title Edit : Specifically the British Army or the US Army Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Simply put , a commissioned officer has his rank by act of Congress . A Non - Commissioned Officer does not . They are distinct rank structures , but the question is really , \" What is the difference between Officer & Enlisted ? \" more than Commissioned ( Officer ) & NCO ( Enlisted ) . Enlisted in the US ( Army ) have paygrades of E-1 ( Private ) through E-9 ( Sergeant Major ) while Officers have paygrades of O-1 ( Lieutenant ) through O-11 ( 5 Star General ) . Commissioned Officers Begin at O-1 , however NCO 's begin at E-4 / E-5 ( Corporal / Sergeant ) depending on specialty , and service . The term ' Officer ' implies Leadership , or more specifically Supervisory or Managerial role of some type , even if it is just a general concept , such as ' leader of soldiers . ' A E-4 will generally be responsible for 4~ people ( a team ) , whereas a Lieutenant will be responsible for 30 - 40 ( a Platoon ) . However there is lots of other things that take place . Lieutenants are usually ' young ' ( college graduates , but still early - id 20s ) , so they are paired with experienced NCO 's E6 - 7s who are able to balance things out . This works out very well . This philosophy extends up the chain of command as well . There is a ' Senior enlisted adviser ' paired with almost every commander .

In terms of the civilian workforce , think of an NCO as being similar to a factory foreman or a store manager who makes sure things get done and run smoothly at the ground level , and an officer as a higher - level manager or executive who keeps the enterprise running across all angles . This is the widest and most broad - brush description possible , since the exact details can vary widely across services and particular job fields .","Others have commented on pay structure , customs and courtesies , etc . but in the end it boils down to this : As a gross generalization , commissioned officers decide the overall direction of effort , and NCOs take charge of implementing the plan with junior enlisted ."],"chatgpt_answers":["In the British Army and the US Army, an NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer) is a member of the military who has a rank above a private but below a commissioned officer.

For a very small amount of water there would be no lasting harm . As the amount increases more red cells would be damaged . The harm from this falls into two categories - as you lose red blood cells , your blood is less able to carry oxygen to other parts of the body , and the substances leaking from the injured cells would in large enough quantities cause harm themselves since the balance of what is kept inside and outside of these cells is delicate and well regulated . If , instead of plain water , water with solutes in roughly the same concentration as the plasma was introduced ( such as \" normal saline \" ) , and the quantities were not ridiculous , then it would simply become part of your circulating blood volume .

The ANS is a control system for involuntary muscles affects things like heart and respiration rates , digestion , body temperature control and urination . The ANS has two divisions . The sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) controls bladder function , among other things .

Part of the SNS response to a full bladder is the release of chemicals like catecholamines ( which include epinephrine , norepinephrine and dopamine ) . When you finally grab a minute to urinate , the PNS takes over , and catecholamine production changes .

At the same time, the muscles around your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) contract to help control the flow of urine. As the urine flows out of your body, it may cause a feeling of coldness or wetness on your skin, which can trigger the micturition reflex. \nThe micturition reflex causes the muscles in your body to contract and release in a series of rapid, involuntary movements.

{"question":"Why did languages start to gender words , especially categorizing most objects as male or female ? This came up in a recent discussion amongst a few English professors , none satisfied with they could come up with . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["It 's not known , but there is some speculation . Essentially , the various grammatical markers that indicate grammatical gender may be ultimately derived from the language 's words for \" man \" and \" woman \" , or \" he \" and \" she \" , for example , originally only used for people , then all animals . This then became a way to categorize other nouns as well . Somtimes , the connection is not too hard to understand . For example , in ancient societies there were gods and goddesses associated with all sorts of things . The sun might be seen as having male qualities -- it 's strong at any rate -- and so to the Romans , Sol , the sun - deity , was clearly a male god , which is why , for example , the French word for \" the sun \" , \" le soleil \" , is masculine ; the moon , on the other hand , being much more gentle , was ruled by a goddess , Luna , hence the French word for \" the moon \" , \" la lune \" , which is feminine . Another way of assigning grammatical gender is by the form of the word itself . Once you have established a list of masculine words and a list of feminine words , you might notice that masculine words follow a certain pattern , while feminine words follow a different pattern . So you allocate new words a gender depending on whether they follow a typical \" masculine \" pattern or a typical \" feminine \" pattern . In Russian , for example , words ending in a consonant are usually masculine , words ending in \" -a \" or \" -ya \" are usually feminine , and words ending in \" -o \" are usually neuter . This explains the famous example of the German word for \" girl \" being neuter . The German word referred to is \" Mädchen \" . This comes from the ( now old - fashioned ) word \" Magd \" , which is feminine and means \" maid \" . The \" -chen \" ending is what 's called a diminutive , and translates as \" little \" -- so \" Mädchen \" means \" little maid \" , and is where we get our word \" maiden \" . But in German , all words with diminutive endings are automatically neuter , no matter what they refer to . By this stage , of course , grammatical gender is a completely different concept from actual gender or sex , and is really just a classification system and no longer an indication of whether something is male or female . English has now come full circle , and we use \" natural gender \" , meaning that women and female animals are feminine , men and male animals are masculine , and inanimate objects are neuter . There are some exceptions ; for example , ships are often referred to as \" she \" , probably because the crew depends on her to keep them alive and safe , but she can be difficult to control ( these are stereotypical female qualities , of course ) .","We 're not really sure why . Human languages like to classify nouns : a lot of languages end up with some combination of masculine / feminine / neuter gender , but others have animate / inanimate gender , and there are a few languages that have over a dozen genders , loosely based on the \" shape \" of the object being referred to . We do n't know what the first languages look like , and we do n't know how gender first appeared . Our best methods for finding out what languages were like in the past only lets us go back 6,000 - 10,000 years at most . There have been examples of gender disappearing from a language ( eg , English , Persian ) , but I know of no languages that did not have gender and then obtained it , so there 's really nothing to go on for how it might enter a language .","Nobody can give a definitive answer to that question , for the reasons that [ HannasAnarion points out in a comment ] ( URL_2 ) . With human languages we can only look back some 6,000 - 10,000 years in the past , but humans have been speaking at least 35,000 years . What I 'll say below is heavily based on [ my answer to a similar thread from some months ago ] ( URL_5 ) . One thing to keep in mind is that most familiar European languages like German , French and Spanish descend from languages that have gender as far back as we can trace them . The farthest we can trace them is to the [ Proto - Indo - European laguage ] ( URL_3 ) , the reconstructed common ancestor of German , French , Spanish , English , Greek , Russian , Hindi , Armenian , Farsi , Albanian , Kurdish , Lithuanian and a bunch of other languages . Linguists are not sure exactly when it was spoken , but hypotheses range from 6,000 to 12,000 years ago . But one thing we know for sure is that Proto - Indo - European had gender , and the German , French and Spanish gender systems are modifications of Proto - Indo - European gender . English is a bit odd among Indo - European languages for having lost its gender system — and that happened less than 1,000 years ago . So the cheap answer to why German , French and Spanish have genders basically boils down to ( a ) they descend from a language that already had gender , ( b ) they have n't lost it in at least 6,000 years , ( c ) we just do n't know why Proto - Indo - European had gender , and in fact ( d ) we * ca n't * know because it 's prehistory . But there 's another way we can look at this question : by examining languages that * do n't * have grammatical gender , but have grammatical rules that are somewhat similar to it . One useful example is Japanese , which does n't have gender , but it does have one grammatical feature that 's very interesting in this context : [ noun classifiers ] ( URL_0 ) ( [ see also here ] ( URL_4 ) ) . Basically , in Japanese , any countable noun phrase requires the use of a * * count word * * or * * classifier * * , and which one is used depends highly on the noun . So you use a different count word depending on whether you 're counting sheep , cars , pencils , etc . At this point you should be struck by the similarity to grammatical gender . In fact , one of the theories about how gender systems develop in the histories of languages is that they start out as classifiers or something similar , and over time the words get \" smushed together \" and what was once a separate count word becomes a prefix or suffix to the noun . Linguists call this sort of process [ grammaticalization ] ( URL_1 ) . One familiar example ( though not about gender ) is that in English we have these three : 1 . I 'm going to let you finish . 2 . I 'm gon na let you finish . 3 . I 'm a let you finish . * I 'm going to X * , which started out with the literal meaning of moving from one place to another , is grammaticalizing into a future tense , and in the process it 's getting smushed together into * I 'm a * . So over thousands of years , you could picture Japanese going through a combination of changes like these : * A lot of the count words become archaic and eventually disappear from the language . ( This has already happened to a bunch of them ! ) * Count words start showing up redundantly on both adjectives and nouns in the same sentence . * The surviving classifiers get thoroughly smushed into the nouns and adjectives , and become prefixes or suffixes . And voilà , grammatical gender ! Disclaimer / clarification : the above is * one * theory of how * some * languages may have acquired grammatical gender . Either of these could be possible : ( a ) the theory is flat - out wrong , ( b ) the theory is true for * some * languages but not for others ( there may be more than one way that grammatical gender systems emerge ) ."],"chatgpt_answers":["In many languages, including English, words for objects, animals, and other nouns are not inherently male or female. Instead, the gender of a noun is often assigned based on the gender of the person or being to which the noun refers. For example, the word \"girl\" refers to a female person, so in English, the word \"girl\" is considered a feminine noun. Similarly, the word \"boy\" refers to a male person, so it is considered a masculine noun in English. \nHowever, not all languages assign gender to nouns in this way. In some languages, the gender of a noun is based on the meaning of the word or its ending. For example, in Spanish, nouns that end in \"-o\" are usually masculine and nouns that end in \"-a\" are usually feminine. \nIt's not entirely clear why some languages have developed systems for assigning gender to nouns, but it is thought that the origins of gendered language may be related to the way that people think about and conceptualize the world around them. Some linguists believe that gendered language may have evolved as a way to categorize and organize the objects and beings in the world in a way that is easier for people to understand and communicate about. \nRegardless of its origins, gendered language is an important feature of many languages and is used in a variety of contexts, including grammar, vocabulary, and even social interactions.

For him , in a simplified view , practices and beliefs in societies always serve certain functions , contributing in a certain way to the success of society . Say you are in a certain technological step and do n't understand the intricacies of pregnancy . Your wife keeps having miscarriages and no one knows why , except for the local religious figure , who has an explanation related to your religion and/or lifestyle ( maybe you did n't sacrifice enough animals ? did n't pray after having sex ? did something the rest of the population is n't used to and , therefore , finds strange ? ) . The point is , people start believing in the religious figure 's instructions , maybe because they know somebody who knows somebody who was healed when they followed all instructions or maybe because everybody 's been following their instructions for centuries already , so why should they stop ? * * TL;DR * * Sex is a very intimate and almost mandatory activity for humans , making it so that it can be done in a multitude of ways and some people might never learn about them , thus allowing for some aspects of it to be found strange or even straight up repulsive ( think homosexuality for people that spent their entire lives thinking about heterosexuality not only as the norm , but as the only logical choice ) . Combine that with the rise of social and religious constructions that mix legitimate spiritual concepts with desire for power and you 've got a subject that is very easy to control and can be very lucrative/ influential .

One reason is that sex can be a private or personal matter for many people, and some cultures place a high value on privacy and modesty. Additionally, many societies have social norms and taboos around sex that are intended to regulate sexual behavior and protect against certain risks or harms, such as unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, or exploitation. These norms and taboos may vary from culture to culture, and they may change over time. \nAnother reason why some societies may be more puritanical about sex is that they may have religious or moral values that discourage or prohibit certain types of sexual behavior. For example, some religions view sex as something that should only occur within the context of marriage, and they may consider certain behaviors, such as premarital sex or homosexuality, to be sinful or immoral. \nIt's worth noting that there isn't necessarily an evolutionary or psychological benefit to being puritanical about sex. Different societies have different values and beliefs about what is acceptable or appropriate when it comes to sexual behavior, and these values and beliefs can influence how people think and talk about sex.

However , the variation between members of the same ethnic group is drastic enough that the averaged difference is relatively small . Also , race in general is a really poorly defined atribute , especially considering how much interbreeding goes on regularly .","Because race is an ambiguous social term , not a biological one . Let 's invent two races . We 'll call then : Blues and Greens . Now , let 's try and define these races * biologically . * Ok , seems easy , right ? Blues are the ones that are blue , and greens are the ones that are green . Now let 's ask ourselves , can these races differ , mentally ? Yes and no . Yes , it may be possible that Blues , statistically , succeed better than Greens based on some sort of test . But also no , because the results of that test , and any statistical difference mentally , * has nothing to do with their race * . After all , we defined their race * only * by their color . Any apparent statistical differences between them in other ways are * * purely coincidental . * * For example , if there was some law that required that Greens were to be lobotomized at birth , then it may be technically true that Greens do not perform as well as Blues on mental tests . But , again , that has nothing to do with the fact that they are Green ( biologically ) . If you altered the circumstances that resulted in the poor performance of Greens , then it 's very well possible they would be on par , or even better than Blues on intelligence , while still being Green . So while we could acknowledge the difference , it would be inaccurate and inappropriate to attribute the difference as some secondary quality of our defined race . What happens if we change our definition , then ? Instead of simply saying that Blues are blue and Greens are green , we 'll say that Blues are a combination of physical and mental traits that are commonly associated with Blues and likewise for Green . This really does n't solve anything and in fact makes it worse . If you incorporate the apparent mental advantages of Blues into the definition of the Blue race , then you 're basically begging the question ; yeah Blues are better , mentally , because you 've defined them to be so . More importantly , since the mental differences are statistical , what do you do when you come across a lower than average Blue , or a greater than average Green ? Since you made the mental ability a defining trait , then technically a dumb Blue * is n't * a Blue nor is a smart Green a Green . It just complicates the issue without resolving anything . To tie this back to the real world , the fact is , we can ( and do ) acknowledge statistical differences among groups of the population with respect to their race , both physically and mentally . But it is not appropriate to then suggest that those attributes are inherent to that race , that race has * anything * to do with those attributes . Race is a poorly defined label , even when you reduce it to a simple acknowledgement of skin color . And it is n't just about political correctness or racism either . Thinking that things like intelligence are qualities of race cloud the real issue . For example , in the United States , minorities make up more of the poorer and lower social and economic classes than whites do . So , as a consequence , the average quantity and quality of education among minorities is generally less than that of whites . So * of course * tests of mental abilities will result in minorities performing statistically worse than whites , * but that has nothing to do with their race . * So if you walk away from that study concluding that minorities are less intelligent than whites , then you 're ignoring the issue of * why * they performed poorly and , therefore , are precluding efforts to try and remedy what is most likely a problem . After all , we can at least recognize poverty and lack of education as a problem that is theoretically fixable .

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The main reason why water burns when it goes up your nose is because the salinity of the water does not match the salinity of the cells in your body . The salinity of freshwater is much lower than your body , so when water gets into your nose and into your sinuses , some of the cells that line the sinus and nasal cavities burst open and die because they rapidly suck in water - like overfilling a water balloon . Your body responds by rapidly secreting mucus to coat the remaining cells and protect them from the water .

This is called \"nasal irritation.\" When you dive into a pool or take a shower, the water can also cause your sinuses (the air-filled spaces in your skull) to become pressurized. This pressure can cause a burning sensation in your nose, as well as a feeling of congestion or stuffiness. \nYour nose and sinuses are lined with tiny hair-like structures called cilia, which help to filter and moisten the air you breathe. When water gets into your nose, it can disrupt the function of the cilia and cause them to stop working properly. This can lead to irritation and inflammation, which can cause the burning sensation you feel. \nIn addition to the physical sensations, the feeling of water going up your nose can also be a bit scary and uncomfortable. It's important to be careful when diving into pools or taking showers to try to avoid getting water up your nose.

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["As someone who suffers from panic attacks on occasion , a great thing to do is to start reading off the symptoms of a panic attack . Unless they 're panicking over something external , most people having a panic attack mistake it for a heart attack . Tingling in extremities , rapid heartbeat ( caused by all that fast breathing ) and so on . Try putting on a metronome ( you can get apps for a smartphone ) to help whoever 's panicking get a sense of time passing . When you 're panicking , your brain starts perceiving everything faster and time slows down . This will also help regulate their breathing . A good pace for breathing is 4 - 7 - 8 : in for four , hold for seven , out for eight .","I am not a doctor . This is not medical advice , but I have lived with three different people prone to panic attacks and learned this that way : * * What happens during a panic attack * * ( Please note : there may be other things at play : this is the \" what happens \" that I know about , and I believe is most common , as I know several people who suffered from these . ) A panic attack is triggered by something - often specific to the person suffering , or sometimes they just happen on their own . The panic response ( in everyone ) triggers heavy breathing to get as much oxygen into the blood as possible ready for a fight - or - flight response . However , in a panic attack this heavy breathing ( hyperventilating ) is overdone , and it actually makes it harder to breath . The sensation of not being able to breath causes new waves of panic , and so it continues . * * What you can do * * Firstly , do not panic yourself . The first time I saw someone have a panic attack I thought she was choking on someone , and started trying to hit her on the back . That was n't so helpful , as it turned out . You should be the paragon of calm . A panic attack is not dangerous . If someone really overdoes the hyperventilating they will trigger a \" breathing reset \" sort of thing , which sorts out their breathing and they quickly calm down . Even if this does n't happen ( which I 've never known to happen ) the worst that can happen is that they 'll fall asleep , but anyway . Secondly , be comforting . One person I knew who was prone to them had flashbacks to a traumatic event that triggered her . By hugging her closely , and talking to her I 'd override her flashback - senses with real - world - here - and - now senses and bring her out of the flashback and she 'd calm down quickly . To her I said things like \" You 're okay , you 're safe . You 're here with me now . Look at me , nothing here can hurt you ... \" etc ... Another person I knew had more random ones . With her I 'd do the same , but try to get her to focus on deep breaths . With a third person I tried the deep breaths thing , but she said it only made her want to punch me , only she was too deep into panic mode to do so . With her I 'd just hold her , try to say calming things and use the tightness of my grip ( tighter , gentler , etc ... ) to try to subtly adjust her breathing and found that worked . Thirdly , talk to them . Some people do n't like talking about it , but you can talk about how to help them . This means you find out what makes certain people want to punch you , or useful things like the \" bring them out of flashbacks \" and stuff .","Deep breaths to ten and back . The key is to be rational regardless of their behavior ."],"chatgpt_answers":["A panic attack is a sudden and intense feeling of fear or anxiety that can be accompanied by physical symptoms such as a racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness, and chest pain. These symptoms can be very frightening and can make someone feel like they are in danger, even if there is no real danger present. \nIf you come home and see your housemate suffering from a panic attack, there are some things you can do to help: \n1. Stay calm and try to stay with them. Panic attacks can be scary, and your housemate may feel very alone and overwhelmed. By staying with them, you can provide support and comfort. \n2. Encourage them to take slow, deep breaths. This can help to calm their body and mind. \n3. Talk to them in a soothing and reassuring voice. Let them know that they are not alone and that you are there to help. \n4. Help them find a comfortable and safe place to sit or lie down. \n5. Offer them a glass of water or a soothing drink. \n6. If the panic attack continues for a long time or if your housemate is in severe distress, consider calling for medical help. \nRemember, panic attacks are not dangerous, and they will usually pass on their own after a few minutes.

{"question":"What 's the difference between Pubs and Bars ? And where do pubs get their names ? Just a thought that has crossed my mind a couple times - I also wondered why so many pubs have the same , or similar names ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["I 'm assuming this us a UK based question ? The word pub comes from the name public house . It originally meant a building that was open to the public to come and relax , socialise and most importantly consume alcohol . Noawadays the name public house means a building owned by a brewery , run by a tenant , for the sale and consumption of alcohol . In UK law you must have a license to sell alcohol , a license to have it consumed on your ( public commercial ) premises and another personal license to facilitate this sale . A pub in the UK is owned by the brewery . They have a tenant that buys the business within the building and then gets to keep the profit made from the sale in exchange for meeting the brewery 's minimum sale requirements . They must buy beer from the brewery and if they do n't buy enough they will be kicked out and another tenant will be found . This leads to , in more recent times , more pubs shutting down due to the aggressive nature of breweries . However you can also have free houses ( woohoo ) which are owned and run by the same person . They are open to buy beer from wholesale shops at a much cheaper price than would otherwise be available through the brewery . This means freehouses generally are cheaper than pubs and can have a different clientele . A bar is normally much more about alcohol than socialising . In a pub it is totally fine , in fact often expected , to sit at the bar with your drink and talk to the other people at the bar . You are of course not looked down upon by finding a private area , that is your choice , but it is often polite to stay and chat for a while . Bars are more aimed at limiting the bar area to sale only , once you have your drink you leave and go back to your private area and socialise mainly with those that you came out with . Pubs will often provide entertainment such as music , darts , snooker and/or pool , with snacks and occasionally food served too . Bars also open different hours to pubs . Because pubs are a social location , in the UK at least many pubs open earlier in the day than bars , sometimes noon , but quite often around 4 pm I have found . Bars are more aimed at night time and weekend rushes and are a more commercial location","I was always under the impression a \" bar \" is a feature ( usually a counter ) in an establishment that serves it 's specialty . For example ; oyster bars serve seafood , salad bars serve bunny - food , alcohol bars serve alcohol . Similar to a kitchen , which prepares food in a restaurant . So a pub could have a kitchen and bar inside meaning it serves food and alcohol .","In the US , the term bar pretty generically apples to all drinking establishments while a pub refers to a place that tries to capture the style and atmosphere of a UK pub .

The idea is that by limiting the amount of data that customers can use, the ISPs can manage their network resources more effectively and offer a more stable and reliable service to all of their customers. \nFor example, if an ISP has a limited amount of bandwidth available and all of their customers are using large amounts of data at the same time, it could cause the network to become congested, leading to slower speeds and a less reliable service. By implementing data caps, the ISP can ensure that there is enough bandwidth available for all of their customers to use, even during times of heavy usage. \nWhile data caps may seem inconvenient for people who use a lot of data, they can be a good option for people who don't use the internet very much or who only need a basic level of service.

{"question":"Why do people have fetishes , and why are some more extreme than others ? Some people like feet , others like bondage , and a few like balloons . Why is that ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Early psychology assumed that fetishism either is being conditioned or imprinted or the result of a strong emotional ( possibly traumatic ) or physical experience . Often , these experiences occurred in early childhood . For example , an individual who has been physically abused could either have a sexual obsession with intercourse , or they could be completely terrified by even the idea of being touched . Physical factors like genetic disposition are another common possible explanation . In the following , the most important theories are presented in chronological order : Alfred Binet suspected fetishism was the pathological result of associations . Accidentally simultaneous presentation of a sexual stimulus and an inanimate object , he argued , led to the object being permanently connected to sexual arousal . The sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld followed another line of thought when he proposed his theory of partial attractiveness in 1920 . According to his argument , sexual attractiveness never originates in a person as a whole but always is the product of the interaction of individual features . He stated that nearly everyone had special interests and thus suffered from a healthy kind of fetishism , while only detaching and overvaluing of a single feature resulted in pathological fetishism . Today , Hirschfeld 's theory is often mentioned in the context of gender role specific behavior : females present sexual stimuli by highlighting body parts , clothes or accessories ; males react to them . * * tl;dr : It 's a normal and healthy part of human sexuality . * *","It 's all part of human psychology .

A centre - right party , and so are interested in lowering taxes and using free trade as a means to bolster the economy . They believe in small government , which under Thatcher meant privatisation of public services like railways , utilities and the mail . These services used to be run by the government , but were sold off to private companies . Under the current administration , they have been cutting the budgets of remaining public services like welfare , local authorities and the NHS at the same time as cutting taxes for top - earners and letting companies like Starbucks and Vodafone away with not paying corporation tax . Basically letting the rich get richer and the poor get shat on . * * Labour * * - traditionally the party of the working class , and up until the late 1990s , the opposite of the Tories . They are a centre - left party , interested in a society in which the rich help the poor by way of free public services , a robust welfare system , and higher taxation for the wealthy . Before the 1997 general election , Tony Blair took the party in a new direction ( \" New Labour \" ) which similarly appealed to the middle classes as well as the working class . Effectively , he moved the party away from all - out socialism to a more centrist party . The party is now at odds with itself , with some members looking for \" Blairism , \" a more centrist party , and others still rocking the old socialism . The party does not have a strong leader , they are about to lose swathes of voters in Scotland which was previously a Labour stronghold ( more on this later ) , and do not have policies which could reverse the damage done to the lower classes ' quality of life under the current administration .

There were a strong third party when British politics was all Labour vs Tory . Since coming to power as part of the coalition , the party has been on a thundering campaign of self - harm . They do n't have the electoral clout to stop the Tories ' harsher policies , and have gone back on their own election promises ( like not raising tuition fees ) .

They do alarmingly well in council and European elections , and seem to draw media attention far greater than their electoral representation should warrant . They have policies on immigration that seem outright racist , and have a habit of blaming immigration for all the country 's woes .

There was a referendum on Scottish independence this year . The pro - independence side lost , but not by very much . The final vote was 55%-45 % in favour of staying in the union . The SNP was the largest party in the Yes coalition ( the pro - indy side ) , and their membership has skyrocketed since the referendum . They are now apparently the third - largest party in the UK , despite only representing 10 % of its population . Scottish Labour were pro - union during the referendum , which many party supporters saw as a betrayal , since they were jumping into bed with the Tories ( properly called the Conservative & Unionist Party ) . Labour support in Scotland has plummeted . Away from the referendum , the SNP do extraordinarily well as leaders of the devolved Scottish Government . They are the majority party in an electoral system that is not supposed to allow one party to hold an outright majority . They have very popular policies like free travel for over-60s , free prescriptions for all , low tuition fees and a student loan system , and a freeze on council tax . They are expected to do very well indeed in the next general election , perhaps representing a majority of Scottish voters at Westminster . * * Plaid Cymru * * - the Welsh national party . Not as popular as the SNP , but not as radical either . They do n't advocate an independent Wales ( despite a lot of Welsh support for just that ) , they only seek to look after Welsh interests in Westminster and the Welsh assembly , which they lead in coalition with Labour . With nationalism on the rise nationwide , they may see a surge in votes at the next election , but not to the same degree as the SNP are expected to . * * Greens * * - as with Green parties worldwide , they have policies of environmental responsibility , sustainability and social justice .

{"question":"how do hostile takeovers work . And what 's up with 5 % . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["A \" hostile takeover \" allows a bidder to take over a target company whose management is unwilling to agree to a merger or takeover . A takeover is considered \" hostile \" if the target company 's board rejects the offer , but the bidder continues to pursue it , or the bidder makes the offer directly after having announced its firm intention to make an offer . A hostile takeover can be conducted in several ways . A tender offer can be made where the acquiring company makes a public offer at a fixed price above the current market price . Tender offers in the United States are regulated by the Williams Act . An acquiring company can also engage in a proxy fight , whereby it tries to persuade enough shareholders , usually a simple majority , to replace the management with a new one which will approve the takeover . Another method involves quietly purchasing enough stock on the open market , known as a \" creeping tender offer \" , to affect a change in management . In all of these ways , management resists the acquisition , but it is carried out anyway .","I 'm not American , so I 'm not sure what you mean by 5 % . There are different ways to conduct a hostile takeover , but a typical Gordon Geckoesque way would be decreasingthe value of the stocks , buying up enough to get influence in the company ( in Sweden generally 10 % of the votes ) , and then either sneakily or openly buying up enough stocks from prefential owners or on the open market to wield control of the company . It often involves shareholders grouping up . When control has been gained , a company can be gutted , directions can be switched and reserves can be liquidated . For example , Volvo at times have had more liquid reserves than they have had share value making it an ideal takeover . At that point , they try to buy back their own stocks or invest somehow to avoid shenanegans .","5 % is the SEC limit where an investor must announce their ownership publicly . Most hostile takeover artists do it serially so once they have taken an interest in the company , management gets a warning to make their shareholders happy ."],"chatgpt_answers":["A hostile takeover is when a company tries to take control of another company without the support of the company's management or board of directors. This can happen when the company that is trying to take over, called the \"acquirer,\" makes an offer to buy the other company, called the \"target,\" directly to the target's shareholders. The acquirer usually offers a higher price per share than what the shares are currently worth on the stock market, which can be tempting for the target's shareholders. \nOne way that the acquirer can try to take over the target is by buying a large number of the target's shares, usually at least 5%. When an acquirer owns 5% or more of a company's shares, it is required to disclose this information to the public and the company. This is because owning a large percentage of a company's shares can give the acquirer significant influence over the company's decisions. \nIf the acquirer is able to buy enough shares to gain control of the target, it can then try to replace the target's management and board of directors with its own people. This can be done through a vote of the shareholders. If the acquirer is successful in replacing the management and board, it can then take control of the company and make decisions about how to run it. \nHowever, hostile takeovers can be risky and can sometimes lead to legal battles between the acquirer and the target. The target's management and board may also try to fight the takeover by trying to find another company to buy the target or by making it more difficult for the acquirer to buy the necessary shares."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, little buddy, a hostile takeover happens when one company tries to forcibly take control of another company without the target company's approval.

A more thoughtful example : a person who loves board gaming , but , having stepped into a game store and knowing how ridiculously many there are , you have have no idea which the person would want without asking ( and thereby ruining any surprise element anyway ) , so you get the person a gift card to the game store . Another more thoughtful example would be a gift card for a particular experience you think the person would like ( such as a restaurant ) that you want the recipient to experience .","I 've heard of gift cards often being seen as impersonal alongside cash , other times they were perfectly fine .

If someone could confirm that that would be great ) Most satellites are destined for geostationary orbit , which is by far the easiest place to manage space traffic . Due to the way geostationary orbit works , any satellite in that orbit will always be at the same height , going the same speed , and in the same direction . Ignoring small perturberances to a satellite 's orbit , you could theoretically line up satellites into a huge conga line that stretches around the Earth , and have it fly around forever without any satellites colliding . In a way , that 's kind of how it works . There is a line of satellites in geostationary orbit stretching around the Earth , filled with all of the gps satellites , all the satellite TV and radio satellites , communications satellites carrying internet traffic , etc , all separated by miles of space between each satellite of course . When someone wants to launch a satellite into geostationary orbit , they pick a spot in this giant conga line and register their choice with the US Navy , then they carefully fly their satellite into its slot in geostationary orbit . Of course , no orbital placement is perfect , and satellites might drift out of their slots , but when that happens , each satellite has on board propulsion systems that can move the satellite back into position . When the satellite is old and outdated , the satellite is usually moved into a higher orbit , called a graveyard orbit , where satellites go to die , and its spot in the conga line goes to another satellite . Other satellites that do n't go into geostationary orbit are usually much harder to control , however , they are watched religiously by workers on the ground . Before any satellite launches , simulations of the satellite 's orbit over its entire lifetime is run , to ensure that the planned orbit will not collide with any other satellites at the same altitude . If a satellite drifts out of its orbit at any time , controllers on the ground will always be there to steer it back into position . Typically when the lifetime for these low orbit satellites is over , they reenter the atmosphere and burn up , ensuring that it does n't become space junk .","The radius of earth is roughly 6400 km .

Would n't it be simpler just to have one blood type ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["In general , we have what we call blood types as a result of our immune system , and how it deals with foreign entities . That 's my understanding anyways . You mention evolution in the question , so I 'll address that first . What we call \" evolution \" is more like a result of a number of factors . Understanding that brings us to why we have features that seem useless or even situationally disadvantageous . When a mutation occurs , the mutation itself does n't care about the organism 's chances at survival due to the change . That 's where \" natural selection \" comes into play , where organisms that do n't get to reproduce die off . But if the organism does reproduce , then the change is kept , and is passed on . That 's evolution So then , why do we have different blood types ? Because some where down the line , we developed antigens , and then they split off into two types , and at no point did they disadvantage the organism . They only become disadvantageous when you need to artificially ( the only way you can ) perform a blood - transfusion .","The advantage of the alleles being different and thus having different blood types would be the same as any other diverse \" feature \" we have . Diversity makes it so that one single pathogen or mutation could not wipe out the entire species . It could also be due to the fact that diversity is unavoidable , there are plenty of ways your DNA can ultimately be expressed , modified , translated etc . and this may just lead necessarily to more diverse \" features \" . We see the features we happen to see because those are the ones which are stable and happen to work . Basically , the reasoning is that we have diveristy because without diversity evolution could n't really work the way it did ; and so , partly the reason we have diversity is because evolution did pan out the way it did .","Having different blood types never made any difference to anybody until we started doing blood transfusions very recently evolutionarily speaking ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure! So, blood types are determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins, called antigens, on the surface of red blood cells. There are two main antigens that determine blood type: A and B. People who have the A antigen on their red blood cells are said to have type A blood, while people who have the B antigen on their red blood cells are said to have type B blood. People who have both A and B antigens on their red blood cells are said to have type AB blood, and people who have neither A nor B antigens on their red blood cells are said to have type O blood. \nNow, why do we have different blood types in the first place? Well, that's because different blood types have different functions in the body. For example, type A blood is good at protecting against certain diseases, while type B blood is good at carrying oxygen to the body's tissues. Having different blood types allows our bodies to be better equipped to handle different challenges and situations. \nSo, while it might seem simpler to just have one blood type, having different blood types actually gives us an evolutionary advantage. It's kind of like how humans have different eye colors, or how there are different breeds of dogs - they all have different characteristics that help them thrive in different environments. Does that make sense?"],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, back in the ancient times when humans were still evolving, our bodies developed different ways to fight off different diseases and infections using proteins called antibodies. These antibodies happen to stick to proteins found on the surface of red blood cells that we call antigens.

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["US politics are extremely divided along internal cultural lines . It is exceedingly rare in the US to change which party you vote for - they appeal to an entirely different group of people , and focus their policies around that group of people . Where many other democracies have parties who 's fortunes rise and fall with the economy or popular culture , in America you are either liberal or conservative , and you generally will shift at most once in your lifetime . Red States are states that almost always vote Republican . Places like Utah or Texas , where a majority of people are conservatives . Blue States are states that almost always vote Democrat . Places like New York or California , where a majority of people are liberals . Swing states are states that have about 50 % of each . This is a place where the ebb and flow of politics has an impact , because how ' energized ' conservatives or liberals feel will impact how many go to the polls . Because of that , these states change who they vote for from election to election - not because their citizens change parties , but because when 10 % fewer liberals vote than usual that electorate swings conservative . It 's a caustic problem that has lead to parties crafting policy to energize their bases , rather than trying to appeal to Americans as a whole . It 's one of the main reasons America sorely needs electoral reform .","Many states have a heavy bias towards one side or the other in an election . It 's unlikely for them to switch away from this bias , and even if they did that would only happen in a landslide election so it would n't really be important . Other states are simply not worth that many electoral college votes so winning them is n't in and of itself that important . Some states though ( Ohio , Florida , and Pennsylvania are the traditional 3 , but Virginia , Colorado , and a few others are sometimes included ) are large enough to be a big prize , and near enough to the center politically that they are open for either side to win . Winning the majority of these states will general mean you have won enough states to win the election ( because it 's presumed you won all the \" easy \" states if you also won the moderately difficult ones ) .","Most states have demographics that are pretty set . It 's quite unlikely for Utah or Idaho to vote Democratic or for California or Vermont to vote Republican . But some states are mixed or balanced demographics ... Florida is sort o a redneck state , except there 's a huge number of immigrants and retired people there who would vote Democrat , and its worth a lot of points . Ohio is another one , were the demographics just do n't lean one way or another .

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The most popular type uses the heat from radioactive decay to heat water and push the steam through turbines that spin and produce the power . \" Starting up \" a reactor means removing enough of the control rods ( radiation absorbers ) that the fuel gets hot and boils water to steam . Maintaining a stable reaction requires inserting or removing fuel or control rods so the temperature and reactions stay within defined ranges . For extra security , a huge pool of water is generally over the rods to absorb errant radiation and cool the rods should trouble arise . Storing the energy does not happen . It 's being created so it can be used nearly immediately . The energy that was stored came in the form of Uranium and other elements forged in the bellies of supernovae billions of years ago and trillions of miles away from us . Tl;dr : We boil water with chunks of solid stars .","First , understand that nearly all electric generation is steam moving a turbine on a generator which creates electricity to transmission along lines or storage in ( capacitors and batteries ) so , nuclear power is used to create heat , to make steam to turn a turbine and make electricity . The Nuclear part is a set of radioactive and nonradioactive rods ( in 1970s technology ) which when set in an array get hot through the reaction , to heat water to make steam to turn a turbine . The rods are set up so as to be raised or lowered to intensify or reduce those reactions , along with insulating material to control the rate of those radioactive reactions and to control the heat created . ( that 's eli5 , with all sorts of near correct info ) .","Many of these answers are not 100 % correct . The internal fuel portion of a nuclear reactor is uranium dioxide , enriched approximately 3 - 4 % , and contained in a fuel rod , which is a part of a fuel assembly containing typically 90 - 120 rods . A fuel cell contains 4 fuel assemblies , which are permanently in place unless a refuel cycle is occurring . The control rod , which contains neutron absorbing elements such as Boron or Hafnium , are moved in and out of the fuel cell to control the number of reactions occurring at any given time . Neutrons love Boron and Hafnium , even more than U-235 - which is why the control rods are made of such elements . It is the free neutrons that produce the nuclear reactions , not the protons . The two common reactor types are boiling water reactor and pressurized water reactor . At a PWR , the water does not boil . The water is kept at such a high pressure that boiling is prohibited and the heat generated by the fuel burn is transferred to a secondary volume thru a steam generator , which boils and turns your turbine . BWRs send water up thru the fuel assemblies , removing the heat generated , boiling and converting to steam by the exit of the top of the fuel assembly . The wet steam goes thru a moisture separator and dryer and off to spin the turbine and make electricity . Nuke plants are very stable once they 're operating . Typically a plant will stay online continuously for 18 - 24 months depending on type of fuel used . A plant maintains operations for so long without refuel by beginning the cycle with a good portion of the control rods only halfway out . Over a couple months , a few rods will be pulled out just a bit , uncovering more of the fuel .

Here's a simplified explanation of how it works: \n1. Inside the reactor, there are fuel rods made of a special type of metal called uranium. These fuel rods contain tiny particles called atoms. \n2. When an atom is hit by a neutron (a small particle found in the nucleus of an atom), it can split into two smaller atoms, called fission. This releases a lot of energy in the form of heat. \n3. To start the reactor, the fuel rods are placed inside the reactor and the atoms are hit with neutrons to start the fission process. This heat is used to turn water into steam, which is used to spin a turbine. The turbine is connected to a generator, which produces electricity. \n4. To maintain stability, the reactor has control rods that can be inserted into the reactor to absorb excess neutrons and slow down the fission process. This helps to control the amount of heat being produced and keeps the reactor running safely. \n5. The electricity produced by the reactor is stored in a power grid and can be used to power homes and businesses. \nI hope this helps!

You see in movies people trapped will rap out SOS by just banging on something and I can see how that will work , just because it 's such a familiar pattern . The thing is that the bang only gives you the start of a dot or a dash so how can you tell which is which . It would be very difficult to tell the difference between a word ending with \" e \" and a word ending with \" t \" . It seems to me that reading arbitrary messages in Morse with just a banging noise would be very difficult with ambiguity and guesswork everywhere . I know the original telegraph operators discovered that they could hear the letters just from the clicking mechanism but those devices made different clicks to start and stop each dot or dash . I learned Morse myself long ago ( for my amateur radio licence ) but was too slow reading to pass the test ( had to take a limited licence ) . My guess is that the movies are about as accurate in this respect as they are in most other technical areas ; not very . In case the other explanations of OP 's question are not clear enough ... Morse is sent by turning your transmitter on and off rapidly . Depending on how fast you want to send , choose one standard unit of time . Then : * transmitting for one unit is a dot * transmitting for three units is a dash * silence for one unit is separates dots and dashes within a letter * silence for three units separates letters * silence for seven units separates words The transmitter does n't actually send a beeping tone ; it 's just full on or full off . The receiver generates the audible tone , essentially based on how far the tuner is off the transmitting frequency . If you 're 1kHz off you 'll hear a 1kHz tone . If there are multiple transmitters close to the same frequency then you might be able to hear them all and have to distinguish them with your ear . And finally , thinking of the letters as sequences of dots and dashes is bad . Memorising them by writing down symbols on paper is a waste of time . You have to practice by listening to each letter 's rhythm and learning those .","Ham radio operator here . There is a standard for the amount of space between letters , and between words .

Arrayed against them are the Germans fighting a primarily defense war . They know the Allies are coming and from where so they have time to set up positions . With the powerful German guns this often means getting highly effective first shots on the advancing Shermans . As a visual example - Watch the \" Tiger \" scene in the movie Fury .

For example, it was faster and more maneuverable than the Tiger, which made it better suited for some types of warfare. \nOverall, the use of Sherman tanks by the Americans was a matter of practicality and strategy.

{"question":"Why does mixing colors of paint work differently than mixing colors of light ? Blue paint mixed with yellow paint will make green paint , but blue light mixed with yellow light will make white light . How is this possible ? ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["With paint , you 're mixing the opposite of light . Mixing paint is combining which colors are absorbed , and thus unseen , while mixing light is combining which colors are seen .","Lamps emits and paint reflects . Let 's assume 3 colours : red , blue and yellow . When I have a white lamp , red , blue and yellow are emitted . When I have white paint red , blue and yellow are reflected . Now here is where it gets different . When I take 2 lamps of different colours and point then at the same spot , the colours get added . So let 's say you get red and blue lamps . Turn then on and you get all the red colours and all the blue colours resulting in a nice purple colour . But now we take paint . When you shine white light shining on red paint , the reflection throws away all other colours , but red . The same with blue paint throwing away everything but blue . So we got our paint and we 're ready to mix red and blue . The red paint wants to throw away the blue colour and the blue wants to throw away the red . Problem ? A bit . There are many shades of red and blue , and some of those shades are a bit alike . A blue - ish red and a red - ish blue are the shades that can still reflect . So our paint mix reflects a blue - ish red / red - ish blue light , but why is it darker , brown - ish and not pretty purple ? Well , we threw away a lot of shades of red and blue leaving not a lot of light to reflect of the paint to reach your eyes . TL;DR Lights add shades of colours to create a new colour spanning a broad colour spectrum . Paint subtracts shades leaving a narrow colour spectrum .","When colors mix , what you 're really seeing is what wavelengths ( colors ) of light are hitting your eye . If they all hit your eye , you see white . or you could get just a red wavelength , or just a blue , or just a green . If you see no light , you see black Paint absorbs light . So if you shine a white light on white paint , it absorbs nothing and sends all the light to your eyes , so you see every wavelength and see white . If you Shine a white light on black paint , the black paint absorbs all the colors , so you get no light in your eye . If you shine a while light on green paint , it absorbs everything but green light , so your eye sees green light . Now the complex part is when you combine them . When you combine lights , your eyes are getting more and more light , so you 're getting closer to white . But when you combine paints and then shine white light on them , the more paint you combine means the more light is absorbed by the paint , so the less light actually reaches your eye , so you get closer to black . Basically , when dealing with lights you 're dealing with what colors actually reach your eye . When dealing with paints , you 're dealing with what colors DONT reach your eye , so to figure out what DOES reach your eye , you do the opposite .

{"question":"Why do people like alcohol ? I am going to college next year and I know that there will be parties all that , but I just do n't get . Especially something like shots etc . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["There are many different reasons to enjoy alcohol . In moderate doses , it makes you feel more relaxed , it may have some health benefits , it enhances the taste of food ( the right wine pairing is an excellent complement to a good meal ) , it can taste good on itself , etc . Beer is extremely refreshing in a hot day , and can be warming in a cold day , depending on the type of beer . To young people , it is attractive because it can make you feel happier , more confident , and take more risks . This is particularly attractive if you are just learning how to behave socially , need to make friends in a strange place , would like to start dating , need to relieve stress - all common situations in college , especially for freshmen . But I think that there is a distortion , in particular in the US . Alcohol in college becomes more important than it should be because for most of the kids , it has been such a taboo most of their lives . College is the first time that you may find yourself without close supervision and surrounded by people your age who have access to alcohol . Then you turn 21 and suddenly you can legally have the stuff . As a result , most Americans are completely unprepared for this , when the time comes . They do n't know what they like , they do n't know what their limits are , they do n't know how their bodies will react , and they have to deal with peer pressure telling them that drinking is required and that being wasted is desirable fro some reason . Finally , there is a small percentage of the population who are vulnerable to alcohol addiction , which is something that you really do n't want in your life . It 's like most other addictions , except that it is very visible , very public , and very hard to escape . For all these reasons , my suggestion is simply , be careful . Do n't let yourself get carried away . Put a very small limit on yourself . Go to a party , for instance , with the firm limit of 1 beer . No matter how you feel then , do n't push that limit . After you go home and it wears off , think about it and see if it would be wise to raise your limit next time . No matter who you are , though , more then 4 or 5 beers in one event are a bad sign . Stay away from hard liquors as much as you can . If / when you are ready to try , make sure you do it with a group of friends , and that at least one of you is going to be sober . You will eventually get a hangover , inevitably . Remember that if you feel bad , it 's for a reason - you probably pushed your body more than it was able to go . Finally , remember that in large quantities alcohol can kill . Every year there are reports of kids killing themselves in colleges , by drinking too much and not knowing how to deal with it . As a parent , this is one of my biggest fears . So know that it is not normal for someone to drink so much that they pass out . If this happens to someone around you , be a true friend and try to stop them . If you ca n't and they do pass out , try to wake them up . Take them home , give them a shower , have them drink some coffee . They can sleep after they feel better .

If there are 20 stores , then each store sells on average 500 mattresses per year , or more than one per day . If it 's an owner operated business with no additional staff , that means he only needs to make $ 200 profit on each mattress ( after rent and other expenses ) in order to have a six - figure income . As others have noted , profit margins are often much higher than that . Another critical factor : Cars , homes and mattresses are about the only things that consumers wo n't buy online , both because shipping is problematic and , more importantly , because they want to actually test it out in person before buying .","The margins on mattresses are gigantic .

I hear too that the water salinity is different between where they initially live versus where they mate , and that poisons them to death too ; but the waters where they mate offer productive advantages through the production of pheromones .

They 're basically spending everything they have to spawn a large number of offspring under ideal conditions . In other species the chance to mate is very rare . For example because they live in very extreme environments . Under those circumstances it 's important to make the most of it to make sure the offspring get 's a good start . In some species this means the female will eat the male ( with or without his cooperation ) , it means the female get 's a good meal in a place where food is scarce . Some species simply only need to mate once . Many social insects like bees and ants have a queen that only mates once , this one mating provides her with all the sperm to keep laying eggs for a lifetime . In these species males only have on purpose , impregnate a queen and then they 're completely useless .

This is in contrast to iteroparity, in which an organism reproduces multiple times over the course of its lifetime. \nOne reason why some species may have evolved to reproduce this way is that it can allow them to put all of their energy into producing a large number of offspring at once, rather than spreading their energy out over multiple reproductive events. This can be especially advantageous in environments where conditions are variable and unpredictable, because it allows the organism to take advantage of good conditions when they occur. \nFor example, salmon reproduce in streams and rivers, and the conditions in these habitats can vary significantly from year to year. By reproducing all at once and then dying, salmon can ensure that their offspring will have a good chance of surviving and reproducing, even if conditions become unfavorable in the future. \nOverall, semelparity may not always be the most advantageous reproductive strategy, but it can be beneficial in certain situations."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well young one, some animals like salmon die after mating once because from an evolutionary perspective, it ensures the survival and health of the offspring.

We know from Chaucer - the most highly reputed English author pre - printing press , whose works were some of the first to be widely printed - that cursing was common , as his novels commonly provided realistic ( read : explicit ) dialogue between characters from different parts of England . As the craft of writing develops in the early Enlightenment we start to see far more euphemism , dirty word play , double entendre , and similar devices ( \" making the beast with two backs \" ) to allude to these topics more lightly . By Shakespeare 's time , there is definitely social taboo surrounding these curses , as none are explicitly mentioned in any of his plays . An important note : At this point these words are considered inappropriate - but they are not yet insults . If you called someone a \" fuck \" in the 1600s in England - they would have no idea how to interpret that other than your body language and tone . More on this later . Continuing from Shakespeare - English writing becomes more and more prudish in its choice of words through the Victorian Era . Some new , creative applications of old swears start to appear - \" fucked \" or \" getting fucked \" gets the meaning of \" being taken advantage of \" in the 1700s for the first time . Overall , the taboo of these phrases only increases in polite & distinguished society , though elsewhere people probably cursed as much as always . The next turning point is the Industrial Revolution . Here cursing starts to really take off - popular swears begin to take on different parts of speech and they start being used as direct insults rather than just chatter about inappropriate contexts ( \" You fucking fuck ! \" ) . Fast forward to the world wars , and swearing has become the most popular thing on the planet . Basically creative measures of cursing explode to the point that we start losing track of them all - \" bullshit \" was Australian or New Zealand soldiers making fun of the British for their keen intent on shining or \" bulling \" their boots . Other compound curses - \" motherfucker , clusterfuck , etc . \" appear around this time of bloodshed and frustration with nationalist governments . Basically these wars are responsible for the \" is my child or my boss around ? no ? well fuck this then \" attitude , and the multitude of curses we can draw from . Is cursing still taboo ? To an extent ... it 's just that our instantaneous communication makes it so that you see it a lot more than you would , and makes it less shocking . Also , cursing does increase your pain tolerance , and there is some interesting information about aphasia ( loss of speech ) and cursing . Patients who have brain injuries that leave them unable to speak , find it easiest to start speaking again through cursing . This and other evidence that curses are linked with the emotional centers of the brain more so than other words suggests that profanity has a lasting purpose in our society - to reduce stress and pain . There are studies that go into Tourette 's and aphasia more to figure out what the neurobiological triggers of cursing are and what it can tell us about our behavioral predispositions . TLDR : ... - 1400 ~ cursing is understood as disrespect to the gods ( or god ) , people curse a lot 1400 - 1600 ~ more educated elements of society start using euphemism , cursing slows 1600 - 1850 ~ growing middle classes begin to take up the taboos of the wealthy , cursing slows more , though creativity and number of curses grows 1850 - present ~ everyone curses however the fuck they want to and most people do n't give a shit","I can contribute to this one ! It depends on the language . For example the Dutch use diseases with kanker ( Cancer ) being the worst one . Kankerzoot ( I think ) is one of the worst things you can say . You 'd say like like we say \" fuck ! \" when something bad happens . I think the French use some kind of religious based thing . Anyway , English was a Germanic language at one point , then England was invaded by people who spoke a Latin language . Once that happened the language of the royalty and high society was this Latin language because they were the conquerors and now ruled everything . Over time these two languages began to blend together but we still had two words for most things ; one Germanic , and one Latin .

The origins of swear words can be traced back to the earliest human societies, where certain words and phrases were used to express strong emotions or to convey disrespect or aggression. \nOne theory is that swear words originally evolved as a way for people to vent their anger or frustration without physically harming others. Swearing may have also served as a way to bond with others and build solidarity, as people who swore together may have been seen as belonging to the same social group. \nOver time, certain words and phrases came to be considered inappropriate or offensive in many cultures and societies, and using them in public or in polite conversation became taboo. In some cases, this may be due to the words being associated with particular groups or activities that are considered taboo or shameful. In other cases, the taboo nature of certain words may simply be due to their association with strong emotions or with disrespectful or aggressive behavior. \nIn general, it is considered rude to use swear words in public or in polite conversation because they can be offensive or disturbing to others, and because they can reflect poorly on the person using them. However, there is often a great deal of cultural and personal variation in what is considered to be a swear word, and what is considered acceptable language."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well kiddo, a long time ago people started using some words to express strong emotions like anger or frustration, and those words were considered inappropriate or impolite for social situations.

I 've taken and passed physical chemistry , thermodynamics and a bunch of other class like it , but this concept still fucking eludes me . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["If you take things and put them together , they will slowly fall apart . This happens on every scale , from the stellar to the molecular . Stars burn out , buildings crumble , organisms die , and molecules break apart . You can fight against it ( new stars can form , buildings can be repaired , organisms reproduce , chemical reactions can create new molecules ) but eventually given enough time , everything will come apart .","Yikes .. the amount of misinformation here . Yeah the whole idea of everything moving towards disorder and decay is very poetic and somewhat based in a scientific principle , but firstly that 's the 2nd law of thermodynamics , not a definition of entropy , and secondly I 'm pretty sure a junior engineering student is aware of that simplification and looking for something a little more scientifically rigorous . Disorder is one definition , but a somewhat ambiguous and debated term these days . It makes it easy to grasp at first , but as you learn more can lead to some confusion and the kinds of misinformation I 'm seeing here . Granted I 'm no expert either , but here 's my take : Entropy you can consider a sort of measure of how easily or impossibly reversible a process is . For a more tangible example : an object falling from a higher place to a low place is a relatively small change of entropy . Assuming the system as simply the object , you need to input energy into the system ( pick it up ) to restore it to it 's old state but that 's pretty easy . Let 's say the object cracks during the fall . Well the change in entropy just got a little higher because you got ta do some more work ( input more energy ) to mend that crack . Now say the object shatters into a hundred pieces , it will be even harder to restore it . You 'll have to work to pick up all the pieces , rearrange them back to their original state , and then somehow bind them back together . Thus that 's a much higher change of entropy . And so on .. In physics this concept is important because things naturally want to go to a state of higher entropy ( 2nd law thermodynamics ) , enough so that it can happen spontaneously without outside input . This is what drives so many things , like heat flowing for hot areas to cold areas or pressure gradients in a system tending to equalize or dispersal of particles . Entropy is how you describe that change . In a closed system , if ice melts in water , the ice got warmer but the water got colder , and the total heat / energy in the system is the same ( ignoring heat of fusion ) . In a closed system , if a bunch of grouped together particles dissipate and spread out , the overall mass / density of that system is still the same . So what changed ? And that 's where the concept of entropy comes in as a measure of that change . Um , so that 's more the classical definition . The concept has evolved beyond just physics and I think the definition then really depends on the application .","It 's just probability . Consider all the possible outcomes of tossing a hundred coins , and make a histogram for number - of - heads . Obviously there 's precisely one outcome for 0 or 100 heads , 100 outcomes for 1 or 99 heads ... and ramping exponentially up to squillions of combinations with 50 heads . Take a given layout of 100 coins on a table , thwack the table with your fist to make coins jump in the air , and you 're pretty much guaranteed that your random change will result in N getting closer to 50 , rather than closer to 0 or 100 . Now repeat the same experiment with hot and cold molecules in a glass of water . There 's a hell of a lot more ways for them to be more or less evenly distributed than there are for them to be separated . As they do the Brownian Shake , the intermixedness is , statistically speaking , only going to increase .

It can be thought of as a way to describe the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system. \nHere's an example to help explain entropy: Imagine you have a jar with 10 red marbles and 10 blue marbles. The jar is organized, with all the red marbles on one side and all the blue marbles on the other side. In this case, the jar has low entropy because everything is very organized and there is little uncertainty about where the marbles are. \nNow imagine that you shake the jar up, so that the marbles are mixed together.

In this case, the jar has high entropy because there is a lot of randomness and uncertainty about where the marbles are. \nIn thermodynamics, entropy is often used to describe the randomness or disorder of a system at the molecular level. For example, when a gas is allowed to expand, the molecules will spread out and become more disordered, resulting in an increase in entropy. Similarly, when a substance is cooled, the molecules will slow down and become more organized, resulting in a decrease in entropy. \nI hope this helps to give you a basic understanding of entropy!

These materials are not so terribly radioactive that they will kill you immediately or even make you acutely ill . They are , however , radioactive enough that if you get lots of them in your body , over a long period of time , they can increase your risk of cancers over the long - term — e.g. over a horizon of several decades . And \" increase your risk \" does n't mean \" you get cancer 100 % \" — it just means that probabilistically , your risk of certain cancers ( and other illnesses ) will increase by a certain amount . Birds and deer do n't generally live several decades . So they wo n't die of radiation - induced cancers , because the time of their development is too long . They do pick up radioactive particles in their bodies , which is only a problem if something more long - lived ( like people ) kills and eats them ( [ wild boar hunted in Germany now have to be screened for radiation because of Chernobyl ] ( URL_0 ) ) . People over a certain age are n't going to die of radiation - induced cancers , either — because they 're going to die of just being old , before the cancers can hurt them . Small groups of people probably wo n't get cancer , because the risk factors are n't increased by so much that the excess cancers would be noticeable . So let 's say that the risk increased so that 1 out of 100 people would get cancer . If only 100 people are living in one of these zones , you 're not going to be able to distinguish the 1 extra cancer over the course of those lifetimes — it might not even occur , but even if it does , it is going to look pretty similar to the sources of cancer that come from other sources . The reason that large numbers of people can not live in these areas is because at that point you would start to see larger numbers of excess cancers , birth defects , and other side - effects of prolonged , chronic radiation exposure starting to show up in the populations .

These games are generally buggy , often badly broken or even borderline unplayable on release until a patch comes out . > > There have also been issues recently where publishers have actively gamed the review system in order to suppress news about their games .

It 's sleazy , bad business , and exists entirely to take advantage of the consumer , and the anti - preorder movement represents people who 're tired of it . >","Tl;dr A lot of games in 2014 were not finished when they were released and had more bugs than a rotting corpse , and yet they still sold them as completed titles .","/u / Nygmus has the cause very solidly explained , but the reason why goes a little deeper . When you purchase a pre - order , you 're giving the game developer money for a promise of delivered content . Many times , pre - order sales are driven by trailers and E3 presentations that create a certain set of expectations for the consumer . However , the developer is under no obligation to meet those expectations when they deliver the final product . Watch_Dogs is an excellent example of showing customers one thing to convince them to purchase pre - orders , and then ultimately delivering something that is less than what was shown . They can do this without consequence , because they already secured pre - order sales . By the time the game launched and people started complaining about the graphics being lower quality than what was shown at E3 , and the gameplay being rather generic instead of the groundbreaking experience that was promised , Ubisoft had already secured a heavy influx of sales revenue ... from pre - orders . The push to stop people from pre - ordering is to force developers to actually face the consequences of launching under - developed games . Assassin 's Creed Unity was a disaster at launch , but Ubisoft did n't face any real consequences for such a terrible release ... they already profited from the pre - order sales . Before pre - orders were so common , a game studio that attempted to launch a game infested with so many bugs would have suffered immeasurable losses , and either gone under or emerged from the experience with a powerful lesson learned . As /u / Nygmus mentioned in the case of Assassin 's Creed Unity , the blackout for reviews allowed Ubisoft to sell a broken game to a large number of people . But let 's ignore reviewers as they get early - access copies regardless of whether pre - ordering is a thing . If no one pre - orders a new game , that game 's sales figures will rely entirely on the game 's merit . If the game is good , you 'll hear about it and can go pick it up . If its bad , you 'll hear about that , and can save your money for something else . And that 's the core of it . By not pre - ordering , we are removing the cushion of revenue protection from developers . Without that cushion , they can not risk releasing a game that under performs . This will encourage some developers to exercise more quality control before releasing a game . It will also have the side - effect of causing some developers to just cancel projects that seem too risky . As a whole , its still a net benefit for the consumer . 2014 was a year where a lot of people gave up a lot of money and ended up being given an unsatisfying experience in return . The only way that consumers can influence developers is through their pocketbooks . And the only way this kind of behavior from developers will end , is if they ca n't financially get away with it . Hence , no more pre - orders . EDIT : I should clarify that in my train of thought above , I use the term developers as a rather loose blanket encapsulation for both developers and publishers . Publishers are usually the ones guilty of the above practices I mention , but developers can still be held responsible , and in some cases are even the ones driving the pre - order trend forward . I think both should be held equally accountable . And for what its worth , Indie developers are n't exempt ... early - access could have been a great tool for indie 's to polish and shape their creations into a profitable consumer - oriented product . But 2014 was determine to make early - access as nasty and filthy a word in this community as DRM and Day 1 DLC . EDIT2 : Oh wow , this frickin ' exploded completely unexpectedly !

{"question":"What is the Mars One missions to Mars and is it really possible and going to happen ? Do they have the funding , technology , proper sanity , ect Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Hey there , aerospace engineer here who has experience in the space industry , and with college level mission design and analysis specifically oriented towards manned Mars missions . Mars one does not have the funding , technology , resources , time , scientific understanding , or technical acumen needed to pull off a mission of the caliber they are proposing . For their mission to succeed , several major things will need to change ; most are completely outside of the organization 's control . First , they will need an exorbitant amount of funds . Their projected plan is to use around $ 6 billion . Not only is this a ludicrously small amount , it 's a pretty sure sign of just how serious their program is ( not at all ) . As a conservative estimate , $ 20 billion is probably a better first guess for development of a Mars surface habitat capable of sustaining 4 people for a number of years . Cost drivers include a complete lack of appropriate Mars EDL ( entry , decent , and landing ) capabilities for large cargo , lack of a properly secured life support and resource utilization loop , launch and in space propulsion costs ( which alone would cost more than their projected mission costs to put several dozen tons of cargo on Mars ) , and other similarly large obstacles that require a good deal of funding well before their company will be able to sell the media rights to anyone ( and as far as I , or anyone else in the public is aware , no one is interested in buying to the tune of $ 6 + billion ) . Technology , science , and R & D : as I 've already pointed out , there are huge technical gaps left to completing a Mars mission , even ignoring the whole \" bring your astronauts home \" problem . Launch costs , Mars EDL , and life support are only the most visible and ( probably ) most costly examples . There are a huge variety of additional technical hurdles that Mars one has made little to no effort to adequately address . No human has ever spend more than a few days in an environment between 1 and 0 g 's . No one has created ISRU capabilities that are ready for industrial use and consumption on Mars . No one has used machines to remotely construct a habitat in a space - like environment , beyond self constructing satellites . No one has built structures on Mars ; the long term corrosive and erosive effects are not understood or adequately modelable on Earth . No one has sampled Martian soil , or measured it 's effects as a possible radiation shield ; without knowing how effective it is , it 's impossible to determine how much needs to be used to safely accommodate your astronauts , and thus how strong your structure needs to be to support it . No one has studied the psychological effects operating on astronauts embarking on known one way missions ; it is difficult to predict how team dynamics will play out , and how the astronaut 's sanity and productivity will be impacted . I could go on , but I think the point is clear . As far as time goes , their proposed schedule is as questionable as their budget , if not more so . With an initial funding of less than a few million dollars , they plan to have a custom built rover designed , built , launched , and to land on Mars by the early 2020 's . Let that sink in for a moment . This sort of endeavor takes many millions of dollars , and years just to develop . Their reason for optimism ? That they are going to reuse designs . To anyone who 's worked in the space program , this is a dubious way to save time and money . While it 's certainly better than starting from scratch ( in some cases ) , entire aspects of the rover 's design will always need to be re - examined , re built , re optimized , re analyzed , and re assessed for their impacts on the surrounding structure . I ca n't go to Lockheed Martin and buy another Mars rover , for buy one get one free . These things are n't bicycles , they are some of the most complicated pieces of robotic equipment designed and built . Testing alone takes years , unless you have the money to burn and risk to take to accelerate the schedule . And again , almost all of their proposed structures are going to need to be designed , redesigned , built , tested , redesigned , rebuilt , and retested from scratch , over many years and for billions of dollars . Their assessment of and relationship to the aerospace industry is also questionable . A true development plan does not consist of \" We will pay companies to design and build components to meet our needs \" . You ca n't go to one company , pay for a Mars rover to build your habitat , then go to another and pay for a habitat , then get to Mars and expect them to work together . You need teamwork , integration , cross compatible requirements and design considerations , communication between organizations concerned about intellectual property , profits , and competition , systems level testing and program management , clear program driving factors , and everything else that goes into making a mission like Apollo or ISS or Skylab work . To give one more , truly solid idea of just how unrealistic their plans are , consider this . To get to the moon on Apollo 8 , three astronauts launched atop a Saturn V in an Apollo CSM . The command / service module had a mass of almost 30 metric tons . It could support three astronauts for two weeks , with around 2 cubic meters of space for each astronaut . At the end of that journey , it was discarded . It had no ability to recycle food or water or air , or generate power . And it was launched on that journey by the Saturn V , the largest rocket ever to launch humans into space , a rocket that had more than twice the payload capacity of the Falcon Heavy , Mars one 's proposed launch vehicle . It took the full force of the US government , spending billions of dollars a year for almost a decade , to build the capabilities to travel to the moon , and the tools , engineering base , and equipment involved . Have spacecraft come significantly further in the intervening decades ? Yes . Has our understanding of the problems involved with a Mars mission ? Yes . Are we considerably more ready to tackle the challenge ? Yes . But that does n't change the fundamental variables : you need mass . You need time . You need money . You need expertise . You need launchers . You need organization , skill , planning , coordination , and a bureaucratic machine built to handle the legal , regulatory , ethical , and political ramifications of the mission you are undertaking .

Therefore, it is not appropriate to try to draw conclusions about a society's attitudes towards sex or relationships based on the content of its pornography. \nAs for the presence of pubic hair in Japanese pornography, this is a matter of personal preference and can vary from one individual to another.

Jenny from Forrest Gump . She gets so much goddamn flak from people who have seen the movie . It 's like they tuned out completely at the normal human experience just because they think Forrest is adorable . Jenny did n't think she was in love with Forrest because she thought she was taking advantage of him the same way her father molested her . For fucks sake , Forrest is retarded . Jenny , out of everyone who 's ever met him , knows this best of all . She knows that her closest friend and only loved one is a fucking idiot . Imagine that . Imagine for one second that the only person who was always kind to you was someone who did n't know any better . Everyone in the world who knew about your father looked at you either as a victim or as something disgusting , but that one man does n't . And it 's because he 's retarded . Jenny does n't think that way at the start . As a kid , she just thinks he 's different and is just glad to have a friend . But as she gets older , especially as a teenager , she realizes that her closest friend will never mature like she does . He loves her like he would anything and everything else , so long as its nice or cuddly , like a pet or a sibling , at least in her mind . Her father treated her like shit , and there was no way in hell others did n't do the same when they found out she was molested . She would have wanted to feel loved . That 's where she gets the abusive relationship crap . She wants so much to be loved that she does n't understand that they are taking advantage of her . She thinks that as long as they are n't forcing her to have sex , that 's normal . Getting beat on , pressured to drug addiction , and dragged around into whatever dangerously extreme political bands they 're into is just fine , as long as they do n't rape her . That 's why she 's so shocked when Forrest defends her from harm . Why would anyone do that if what they 're doing to her is normal ? She keeps leaving Forrest behind because she convinces herself that he does n't really love her . She convinces herself that his affections are shallow , since he would never be able to really understand love either . I mean really , how many of you honestly think someone who is that mentally challenged could understand the complexities and nuances of love ? There 's no way they could . What they have is something simple , and Jenny does n't think that could be real . And even IF she believed he could , even IF she got out of that abusive cycle , she knows better . FFS , if that scene with Forrest and her in her college dormroom had the genders reversed , people would be so fucking uncomfortable about that scene because it 'd be inching so close to rape . Jenny knows that . She realizes that . That is why she shuts off her feelings for Forrest , above any other reasons to stay away : she thinks she is molesting him . She saw how uncomfortable he was when she did that and thought holy fuck , what the hell am I doing ? Can you imagine how twisted you must feel after realizing in that moment that you turned into the father who molested you ? How the fuck can you love yourself after doing that to your best friend , when you know what that 's like ? Would you ever let yourself get close to them again if you really cared about them ? So Jenny kept running away . Every time Forrest gets close and saves her , she runs off before she falters . She wo n't let herself get near him , and as the movie goes on , she fails a little more each time . First she blows him off after the strip club , telling him to stay away . Then she walks with him in DC , but still leaves with her boyfriend . Then she stays with him in his house and finally sleeps with him , after that one critical moment . When he tells her he does know what love is , and asks her why she does n't love him . She finally gives in and does sleep with him , but can you imagine thinking afterwards ? Would you , in her shoes , with absolute and unwavering certainty , think you did the right thing ? Or would you be afraid that you did exactly what you had been avoiding because you do actually care that much about him ? So she runs away . She hides her child from him , because she thinks he should n't have to worry or pay for something he ca n't handle . She thinks she 's wronged him , and the least she could do is set things right by raising a good child , without dragging him down . And then she gets sick . Doctors do n't know what it is , but she 's going to die . Her kid is only a few years old . Can you imagine struggling with that decision to tell your victim that they have a kid and now they have to take care of it because you 're going to die ? That 's what she struggles with before coming to terms with the fact that she 's happy with him , and he 's happy with her , and that 's what love actually is . It 's something simple and unconditional , and even Forrest can understand it . It takes her her whole goddamn life to figure out that love is just that simple , and she dies months afterwards . She realized she had been running away from what made her happy , and it is n't wrong , and she only gets so much time together before it 's over . And instead of realizing that narrative even exists in the story , people just bitch about how Jenny is such a slut , but she wo n't even love the only person who cares about her . Jenny always loved Forrest , during the whole fucking movie . She loved him so much , she thought she was taking advantage of him and ran away for his sake . She did n't realize she was wrong until it was almost too late . Fuck , that 's depressing .

This is why your dog may be able to hear your voice or other sounds while sleeping, but may not react to music or other digital sounds. \nOne reason for this is that animals are more sensitive to sounds that are associated with potential threats or dangers. For example, a dog may be more likely to wake up if they hear the sound of someone approaching or talking, because these sounds could indicate the presence of a potential threat. On the other hand, music and other digital sounds may not be as closely associated with potential threats, so the dog may not react to them as readily. \nIt's also possible that your dog may have become accustomed to hearing music while they are sleeping, and has learned to ignore it as a result.

{"question":"How does city zoning work in London ? For example , Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster which itself is in the city of London . How is it that a city exists within a city ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Lifelong Londoner here . I 'll try to explain . First , you have one outright mistake in your question , and a couple of points of confusion . The outright mistake is this : \" Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster \" . No , it is n't . So let 's try to clarify . \" Greater London \" is a geographic and political entity . It 's approximately 600 square miles in size and has a population of around 8.5 million people . Certain functions , such as transport and many development and economic issues , are considered important enough that there is an elected mayor for the whole of Greater London ( known , unsurprisingly , as the Mayor of London , but we 'll come back to this ) , and an elected body , the Greater London Assembly , which between them set policies . The Mayor and GLA also provide the budget for the police and fire service in London , and have a say in their running . To provide more local representation and deal with less London - wide issues , Greater London is then subdivided into 33 boroughs . One of these boroughs is the London Borough of Camden , another is the London Borough of the City of Westminster ( we 'll come to the reason for it having \" city \" in its name later ) . But Camden and Westminster are completely separate entities ; apart from the fact that they 're both one of the 33 boroughs they have nothing else in common . Most of the boroughs have an official name of \" The London Borough of * whatever * \" but a couple are called \" The City of * whatever * \" . This is because the history of human settlement in the London area dates way , way , back , long before the establishment of Greater London . For example the city of Westminster grew up from about the 10th century , so as the area that was later called London grew it was eventually swallowed up . The borough retains the name of what was once a separate , independent city , however . And then there 's the borough called \" The City of London \" . This one is special in many ways . The City of London ( the word \" City \" is * * always * * spelt with a capital in this context ) is tiny . It 's only about one square mile in size . It 's essentially the area that once sat within the old Roman walls of their city of * Londinium * , and today it 's completely dominated by being the headquarters of many financial companies -- so much so that in the UK simply saying \" The City \" is a shorthand way of saying \" financial services companies \" , just as in the US saying \" Wall Street \" has the same connotation .

{"question":"How do chinese people Alphabetize ? EDIT : Oh shit , I need to get bored in class more often . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Just like everyone else ; the English alphabet does n't change if you 're Chinese ... On a more serious note , there are two ways : 1 . You group in radicals ( i.e. the radical 女 means \" woman \" and makes all characters that contain it have a feminine quality : - 妈 = Mother - 姐 = older sister - 好 = good Within radicals , you group by number of strokes needed to write that radical : - 女 takes 3 strokes to write - 木 takes 4 strokes to write Therefore , words that contain 女 as a radical come before those that contain 木 in a dictionary . For a complete list of radicals in the order they come in a dictionary : URL_3 2 . The other way to alphabetize is quite modern since it 's a western adaptation . Every character in mandarin Chinese can be pronounced using the western alphabet plus an accent , so in dictionaries that use this classification , they 'll convert 女 to \" nǚ \" , 妈 to \" mā \" , 姐 to \" jiě \" . It would work just like an English dictionary , j coming before m , 姐 would come before 妈 . Now to classify accents , they follow this simple order : - Flat accent ( horizontal line above the letter you want accented ) comes first : - ( e.g. ā ) - Ascending accent comes second : / ( e.g. é ) - Valley accent comes third : v ( e.g. ě ) - Descending accent comes fourth and last : \\ ( e.g. à ) There are of course special cases like ¨ , but that 's more advanced , and not incredibly relevant to the main question . Third way , mentioned by someone else that I did n't know about ( probably the most ancient of all 3 methods ): URL_0 EDIT : WOW THANK YOU FOR GOLD ! EDIT2 : The proper word for \" accent \" is \" tone \" as some have pointed out . Also , for tones in Cantonese : URL_1 EDIT3 : changed \" neutral accent \" to \" flat \" EDIT4 : Some have asked why 木 takes 4 strokes , when you can technically do it in 3 . The ^ in 木 is n't a legitimate stroke ( based on millennia of customs ) . List of legitimate strokes : URL_2 EDIT5 : Added \" sort by stroke \" , 3rd method .","China , Taiwan and Singapore use a system called [ Pinyin ] ( URL_0 ) which transcribes the Manderin pronunciation of Chinese characters into the Latin alphabet and is alphabetized similar to in English .","Long time lurker , first time poster . So let 's get started shall we ? I speak Mandarin as my second language , and am more familiar with the simplified version . There are two types of Mandarin : simplified and traditional . Trust me , the traditional version is much more convoluted than the simplified one . Firstly , in Mandarin , there is probably no equivalent of alphabetization , at least not in the conventional way . This is n't really surprising , since the characters descended from pictograms - images that convey a message . Thus , you can see that Mandarin characters more closely resemble pictures , rather than the normal alphabets that we see in English . Now then , how do we depict Mandarin characters ? Most simple characters consist of a left side and a right side . In some cases , both sides tell a story . For example , the character 话 is made up of 言(this is the traditional version of the left side ) and 舌 . The left tells us that this word is related to speech , since 言 means speech . The right is the character for the tongue . Put them together , and you get the character for the English equivalent of word . Speech from the tongue = word . Then again , it is n't always so simple . For some characters , only one side tells a story . I 'll take the example raised by /u / pudmedcentury . 姐 is made up of 女 and 且 . 女 tell us that this character is referencing to something feminine . However , as far as I know , 且 does not give any meaning to 姐 . For the record , 姐 means older sister , which addresses the feminine portion . Some characters operate in a different way - up and down . The character 烫 which means hot or scalded , is made up of 汤(soup ) and 火(fire ) . In the past , people probably got scalded by hot soup most frequently , leading to this character . Fire + soup = hot ( or if you are unlucky , scalded ) . There are many more orientations to Mandarin characters , including single words ( e.g. 人 which means person ) , top - left - right ( e.g. 森 which means forest ) , left - top - bottom ( e.g. 祸 which means disaster ) . As usual , some parts have meaning , some parts do n't ( as far as I know ) . There are just too many to list , and as such , I do n't think that Mandarin characters can be alphabetized in an English sort of way . How then do Mandarin dictionaries work ? Every character has a pronunciation , which is translated to English alphabets . So 森 is sen , 人 is ren , 烫 is tang . Basically , all the characters are arranged in alphabetical order , which makes the foundation of the dictionary . However , every translation normally has 4 tones . In Mandarin we call them 声(shēng ) , or sound . In speech , the 4 tones of the same translation sound different , with each tone having many characters . So 汤(tāng - first tone ) , 堂(táng - second tone ) , 躺(tǎng - third tone ) , 烫(tàng - fourth tone ) all sound different and have different meanings , 堂 , 糖 , 塘 , 膛 ( táng ) all sound the same , but have different meanings . Characters in dictionaries are first arranged by alphabets , and within same translations , arranged by tones . This is probably the closest that we have to alphabetization in Mandarin . There are many more aspects to Mandarin , like the fifth tone ( ü ) and the sequence to writing Mandarin characters . This is an incredibly complex language to learn with an incredibly large amount of vocabulary . Feel free to ask any questions or correct any mistakes that I made , or even to ask for the meaning of any characters that I used ."],"chatgpt_answers":["In China, the official writing system is Chinese characters, which are not based on an alphabet. Chinese characters represent the pronunciation of a word and its meaning, but they do not represent individual sounds like the letters of an alphabet do. \nInstead of using an alphabet, Chinese people use a system called pinyin to alphabetize words. Pinyin is a system that represents the sounds of Chinese characters using the letters of the Latin alphabet. For example, the Chinese character for \"apple\" is 苹果 (píng guǒ) in pinyin. \nTo alphabetize words in Chinese using pinyin, you would simply arrange the words in order based on the pinyin spelling.

Did they just have to go around testing and killing people with the wrong blood type till they got it ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Some quick background : blood types overlap , for instance someone who has AB positive blood can have blood transfusions of any type without reaction . Whereas someone who has A positive can receive all but B positive or B negative . In a case where someone gets a transfusion of the wrong type ( This pretty much does n't happen ) then that blood is seen as an \" intruder \" and the body starts to attack it . As the antibodies bind to the red blood cells they will start to group together which can create blood clots , then the antibodies destroy the cells . However as I said this does n't happen as you always check blood types before doing an transfusion . Only time you would n't check is if its an emergency where you would use O negative since its a universal donor .","When a foreign body enters your blood system ( a virus , a bacterium etc . ) it has antigens on it surface . Think if these antigens as an ID for that body . Your immune system can read these antigens , and if it recognizes them as friendly , it lets them be , if it does not , it attacks them , and if it remembers them as a pathogen ( disease causing body ) it uses specific attacks . Now your own blood cells have antigens too , and your blood type corresponds to the presence of that antigen . A means antigen type A , B means type B , AB means presence of both , and O is presence of neither . If you 're type A and you 're given type B blood , your immune system will attack the type B blood cells because it wo n't recognize them , it will however , leave your type A cells alone . Your immune cells and antibodies ( proteins that help fight disease ) will attach to the foreign blood cells and destroy them . This can cause blood clots , and result in internal hemorrhage ( bleeding ) , which can lead to death . This is why blood typing is very important . There is also another aspect of blood typing to consider , this is Rh factoring . This is what is meant by being A positive , or B negative . Positive Rh means that you have the Rh antigen on your blood cells , and Rh negative means you do not . If you have are negative for Rh , and you receive Rh positive blood , regardless of whether the A or B was correct , the immune system will still attack the Rh positive blood . This is why AB positive is the universal recipient , as it has both AB , and Rh antigens , so the immune system has been exposed to everything , and it will not attack any different blood type . It is also why O negative is the universal donor , it has neither A , B , nor Rh antigens , so the immune system does not attack . ( AB and Rh are not the only antigens on your blood cells , there are many more , but these are the three most important ) Source : 5 years in EMS and various physiology classes","Your blood type is based on what proteins are present on the surface of your red blood cells . There are three types of proteins we 're interested in . We will call these proteins A , B and Rh . You can have all of these proteins , none of them , or any combination . The letter part of your blood type is determined by the A and B proteins . If you have both types , you are AB . If you only have A , you are A , only B is B. If you have neither A nor B , you are type O. O means \" lacks both A and B. \" The + or - on your blood type is based on the Rh protein . If you have the Rh protein , you are Rh positive , which gives you a + on your blood type . If you do not have the Rh protein , you are Rh negative , and get a - on your blood type . A - is similar to type O. It just means your blood does not contain this protein . Your immune system will attack anything it does n't recognize . That includes blood cells . As long as the blood cells in a transfusion do not have anything your body does not recognize , your body will accept it . If your body sees a protein it does not recognize , it will attack the new blood cells . For example , if you are B+ and you get any type of blood with the A protein in it , your body will attack the new blood . As long as the new blood does not contain A , it will work just fine . This means a B+ can accept B- , O+ , etc . , but not A- , AB+ , etc . This is why O- is called a \" universal donor \" . O- blood can be given to anybody . The immune system of a B+ person will look at the O- blood and say , \" I do n't see anything here I do n't recognize \" and leave it alone . This makes O- blood more in demand , because if someone in an emergency room needs a blood transfusion , and there 's no chance to find out the blood type , they have to use O- to be safe . This also makes it sort of nice to be AB+ , because an AB+ can receive blood from any donor ."],"chatgpt_answers":["When a person receives a blood transfusion, it is very important that the blood type of the donor and the recipient are compatible. If a person receives a blood transfusion with incompatible blood, it can cause serious problems and can even be life-threatening. \nThere are different blood types, and each person has one of these types: A, B, AB, or O.

{"question":"When a singer is performing during a concert and they have an earpiece , what are they listening to ? Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this question , but I thought it was appropriate than askreddit . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["It 's an in - ear monitor . It helps the singer keep in tune by blocking out external noise and playing back the band audio through the earpiece so the singer can hear themselves in relation to the rest of the band . Without such monitors , it 's actually very difficult for singers to sing in tune because the sound of the band gets drowned out by everyone in the audience and most people ca n't sing with absolute pitch ( i.e. sing the correct frequency / pitch without a reference point ) . As an alternative to ( or in combination with ) in - ear monitors , there often speakers set up on stage that are pointed directly toward the singer / band members that perform a similar function . In - ear monitors are also sometimes used to secretly provide instructions or other messages to performers . Edit : It 's also worth noting that , in some cases , the audio played back through the in - ear monitor is a pre - recorded version of the song ( e.g. from an album ) . Each band member and/or dancer can then match their live performance to the track played in their ear . This has the added benefit of maintaining consistency ( e.g. in tempo and pitch ) across performances . This approach also keeps the singer in tune , so long as the band instruments are tuned correctly .","In a live music setting you generally have two people who are behind the scenes making sure the music is at the right levels . The first person ( arguably the most important ) is the FoH , or Front of House . This engineer is responsible for the sound the audience hears . The entire mix is sent to FoH and blasted out from the speakers you 'll notice above the theater , etc . The two most important roles for this Engineer is : 1 . Avoid any type of feedback at all costs , through EQ'ing and Limiters / brickwallers . 2 . Providing a good public mix for the audience . The second person ( the one responsible for those in - ear mics ) is the Monitor Engineer . This engineer is solely responsible in doing two objectives : 1 . To prevent feedback to the artist 's in - ear mix or stage monitor mix . 2 . To provide each artist with their own custom mix to aid in bettering the artist 's performance . Often times , each musician / artist on stage will request a different mix of the live mix in order to help them . For instance , a singer might not want to hear anything in his / her mix but the snare top and the bass drum / guitar . The guitarist might not want to hear anything but the drums and the singer . Likewise , the drummer may only want to hear the bass and the guitars . This ensures that each artist only hears the elements of a track or song that keep them in time and focused . There are many bands who absolutely hate in - ear monitors , and some who can not live without them . Taylor Swift can be found in one of her videos ( sorry , do n't have the link ) taking out her in - ear monitor because she has a huge problem with not being able to focus properly with two mixes . For the early part of her career , you could see her rip out her IEMs multiple times , and it would frustrate the monitor engineer quite a bit , because they were n't sure if she was having issues with the mix or if she just could n't coordinate the two mixes . Other bands , like Muse absolutely love their IEMs . Here 's the IEM mix for Chris from Muse ( bassist ) on Hysteria : URL_1 Notice that there is very little guitar or anything else mixed louder than the metronome track ( what we would call a \" click track \" ) . These IEMs are fantastic for bands with progressive track layouts or fast - paced - tough - to - nail rhythms . For most house bands , IEMs are not necessary ( especially in smaller settings where the band is close to one another or have their own stage monitors set up . Some bands use both and some bands use one or the other . Protip : When working as a Monitor Engineer that has both on stage and IE monitors , turning down the on - stage monitor volumes when a musician approaches their microphone to sing or have IEMs in can keep from causing feedback loops . When an artist walks away from a monitor , there is no need to have that monitor play , so it is turned down . Protip#2 : IEMs can cause feedback , too ! There are many situations in which an artist 's mix is so loud or turns their head to the side that the microphones can pick up the Monitor Engineer 's mix , causing feedback . This will feedback into the Mon . Engineer 's mix and cause huge issues for both the artist and the Mon . Engineer . Hope this helps you understand the importance of not just IEMs , but the roles of those associated with taking care of those monitors . EDIT : As many have pointed out , IEMs can also provide a method to relay instruction from the Monitor Engineer or other black - shirts ( those guys responsible for bringing the sound to you ) .

One reason is that our brains are larger and more complex than those of many other animals, and so we have had to trade off some abilities in order to develop others. For example, while we might not have as good a sense of smell as a dog, we have much better language skills and problem-solving abilities. \nAnother reason is that humans have developed other ways of finding food and avoiding danger that do not rely on our sense of smell.

In some realms a noble might grant nobility to some degree or another for military accomplishments , or simply because they liked that person . > What powers and responsibilities were granted to those of noble families ? Again , varies realm to realm . A duke , count or whatever might be charged with defending the realm from the other kingdom that bordered their lands . Some were charged with meeting quotas for food harvested or for providing soldiers . Some held the power to , along with the other gentry , select the king or depose him . Some realms had - at least on paper - royal families for all time that could never be deposed or overruled .

As for the nobles , I suspect that in many cases they would 've been conquering invaders whose descendants remained a specialized noble / warrior class . In the period of instability that followed the fall of the Roman Empire , there were opportunities for barbarians to attack peasants , or for groups of warriors to get peasants to give them tribute in return for protection . Then you have a knightly or warrior caste emerging . The Normans are an example . They were Viking invaders who raided France . Then the French king gave some of the Vikings land in return for helping to defend France against other Viking raiders . So the Viking Normans became French nobles .

If you tried to print it 10 \" x 10 \" , you would have 100 dots per inch ( 1,000 dots / 10 inches = 100 dots per inch ) . On the other hand , if you tried printing a 5 \" x 5 \" print , you would have 200 dots per inch and the picture would look much clearer .

First , when a lobbyist gives money , they 're probably not giving their own money . Instead , they they are giving money from a Political Action Committee which collects money from other donors . Corporations can also have corporate PACs . This is important because lobbyists are speaking on behalf of others . In the US there is a constitutional right to petition government . Donating to political campaigns is also recognized an as expression of free speech . The US also has a strong tradition of legal representation -- Americans generally want a lawyer to advise them on issues in the courtroom whereas in some other , often authoritarian countries , you do n't have that luxury and are forced to navigate a complex legal system you do nt understand by yourself . So when a lobbyist donates money to a politicians campaign , they are ( 1 ) assisting donors to exercise their freedom of speech and ( 2 ) assisting donors to petition their government . Lobbyists are specialists , just like plumbers or lawyers . They understand the byzantine way that a government works and they can provide expert advice about what is realistic , what is ethical and how to accomplish a goal . So , now the question is , does money equal access . The answer , based on a long history of studies is -- yes . Money does get you access . But you can also get access when you do n't give money . And you can be ignored even if you do give money . Getting in the door is really hard and really important . I ca n't tell you how many hours I 've spent just trying to figure out how to get into a room . That said , getting into a room does n't get you anything more than face time . I 've sat across a coffee table from members of congress who loathed the group I represented . Being in their presence did n't get me anything ( other than making conservative members of my group happy that i reached out ) . I do not agree that corruption is getting in the room . It does n't actually get you anything . Getting something is ... well ... getting something . And yes , you do see that some companies are able to getting everything that they want from certain members of congress , but the reality is that * * they were bought and sold before they even ran for office . * * Another thing -- if you talk to lobbyists , a large percentage , i 'd say half , will say that money really does ruin politics . I personally believe in 100 % public financed campaigns and a prohibition on any contribution or in kind contribution . It will never happen , and the reason is not because politicians wo n't let it happen . The reason is that the public wo n't let it happen . Politicians are n't any different than anyone else . They 're just a reflection that people do n't like to see .","It is considered to be corrupt by a lot of people , in fact that s the definition of corruption , although the government wo n't admit it .","Short answer : it depends on the country . I try to answer this without bringing my own opinion into it : Most countries have some forms you could ( depending on your opinions ) call legal corruption . For example : some democracies have non - professional parliaments - that means that the law - makers have their own job and business and only go to the parliament twice a year or so ( Switzerland would be an example for such a system ) . This means , of course , that these politicians have economical interests . You could argue , that this is some kind of corruption , since these guys will vote for their interests . On the other hand , people who vote them into the parliament know this . A teacher might vote for another teacher and a farmer for another farmer - since they know they will have roughly the same interests . In the US it is legal to donate for political campaigns - but you have to do so un - anonymously . So you are free to see , who finances Obama and who finances Romney . So the idea would be , that you could look up the donators which would tell you , which interests the politician will represent . This is true for most countries and most countries regulate this process in some forms ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Lobbying is a legitimate way for businesses, organizations, and individuals to try to influence decisions made by government officials, such as lawmakers. Lobbyists may give campaign donations to politicians in order to gain access to them and present their viewpoints on issues that are important to them. While this type of activity may be seen as potentially influencing a politician's decision-making, it is not necessarily considered corruption. \nCorruption is generally defined as the abuse of power or position for personal gain. In the context of lobbying, if a politician were to grant special favors or take specific actions in exchange for campaign donations or other forms of personal gain, that would be considered corruption.

Some people also get it from mild allergies to something in the plant . Drugs that cause increases of seratonin levels ( cocaine , LSD , MDMA ) cause dilation . Seratonin stimulates the 5 - HT2A receptor . It has an inhibitory effect on areas in your visual cortex . I suspect its inhibiting the ability of the sphincter muscles that constrict your iris to work . More simply , drugs like LSD cause a bunch of a chemical to pool in your brain that shuts of the iris constriction muscles . Some drugs increase norepinephrine levels , including cocaine and meth . This stimulates the sympathetic nervous system , causing the \" fight or flight \" response . One of these responses is the dilation of the pupils . This uses the iris dilator muscle , which does the opposite of the sphincter muscle and pushes the iris open . Opiates cause pupil constriction .

I also just found that dextromethorphan ( DXM ) acts on the parasympathetic nervous system , so I would also expect it to cause constriction , though I do n't know for sure . Glassy eyes are caused by drugs that depress the central nervous system . One reason this happens is that you blink less if your nervous system gets turned down .

Not just planets . You have a gravitational pull and so does your cat and your socks . Everything with mass is constantly pulling on everything else with Mass no matter how far they are . If they are n't moving fast enough to counteract the force pulling them together then they eventually collide and form a larger object with a greater pull . This continues to happen until you get planets . In some cases the planets get so massive that their gravitational pull is stronger than the forces keeping atoms far apart and then the sun will collapse into a black hole . Second question : > There are three main sources of heat in the deep earth : ( 1 ) heat from when the planet formed and accreted , which has not yet been lost ; ( 2 ) frictional heating , caused by denser core material sinking to the center of the planet ; and ( 3 ) heat from the decay of radioactive elements .","Click all over the screen and then watch patiently : URL_0","It 's a domino effect .

A little smoky air now is better than a lot later ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Prescribed burns are a way of intentionally setting fire to a specific area in a controlled and planned manner. They are often used as a tool for managing forests and grasslands. \nThere are several reasons why prescribed burns can be good for the environment: \n1. Prescribed burns can reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. Wildfires can be extremely destructive and dangerous, and they can be difficult to control once they start. By conducting prescribed burns, land managers can reduce the amount of dry, dead vegetation that can fuel a wildfire, which can help to prevent future fires from spreading out of control. \n2. Prescribed burns can improve habitat for wildlife. Many plants and animals depend on fire to maintain their habitats. For example, some plants have seeds that only germinate after a fire, and some animals rely on the open, grassy areas created by burns for foraging and nesting. \n3. Prescribed burns can improve the health of forests and grasslands. Over time, dead plants and debris can build up on the forest floor, which can make it difficult for new plants to grow. Prescribed burns can help to clear out this debris, which can allow new plants to take root and thrive. \n4. Prescribed burns can also help to improve air quality. When vegetation is burned, it releases smoke and other particles into the air. While this can be a concern for air quality in the short term, prescribed burns are typically conducted in a way that minimizes the amount of smoke produced, and they can help to reduce the amount of pollutants that build up in the air over time. \nI hope this helps to explain the benefits of prescribed burns.

Well ... guess what radio waves are ? They 're a magnetic field that fluctuates in reaction to a sound source , like say a microphone . A radio antenna is just a long thin wire that 's sensitive enough to get a current when the radio waves hit it . Your radio then amplifies that current and pumps it in to a speaker , and since it 's fluctuating the same way the original wave was , the speaker ends up making the same noises the microphone captures on the other end . You know what else has a long thin wire hooked up to an amplifier and some speakers ? Your headphones . Electrically speaking your headphones / speakers are extremely similar to a radio - the only differences is that a ) you have no apparatus for tuning the frequency and b ) the headphones are usually receiving a stronger signal that overpowers any radiowaves that get picked up ( ie , the computer or whatever that you have the headphones plugged in to ) . Every now and then you get lucky ( or unlucky ) and radio waves DO overpower the local signal for whatever reason , and that 's when you hear radio in your ears .

For example , if I accidentally leave my cell phone too closer to my speakers I 'll sometimes audibly hear my text messages go out .","Speakers are essentially a loop of wire next to a magnet . running a current through the wire creates an electromagnet which is attracted to or repulsed by the magnet . Which is what makes the speaker move and create sound . A radio signal can be picked up by any wire , converting to electricity in the wire ( that is how an antenna works ) . So a radio signal , if strong enough , will create an electric current in the wire in the speaker , making a sound . That is why for example speakers makes a noise if you call someone on your mobile phone too close to a speaker . In the case of your link , that is a microphone , which is kind of a speaker in reverse . The thing is that the electric current generated in a normal microphone is really weak . So it 's amplified a lot in the computer for it to be heard . But as I explained , every wire is essentially an antenna , so the wire between your headset and computer will pick up radio signals .

Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, just like light or heat. Electromagnetic radiation is a type of energy that travels through the air (and through space) as a wave. \nRadio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation that travels through the air at the speed of light. They have a longer wavelength than other types of electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light or X-rays. Radio waves are used to transmit information, such as music or news, through the air from one place to another. \nHeadphones and speakers are able to pick up radio waves because they have a small device inside called a radio receiver. The radio receiver is made up of tiny electronic components that are able to detect radio waves and convert them into an electrical signal.

{"question":"What gives atoms their various properties ? Glancing at the period table I can discern no pattern . Can you predict what behaviour an atom will have because of the balance of subatomic particles in the system ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Yes , broadly speaking . Atoms gain their properties due to their valence . Learning about this is basically most of the first semester of a college chemistry course , but the short version is : Atoms are basically clouds of electrons surrounding a core of protons and neutrons . The clouds of electrons behave in a way that is random , but overall very predictable , and they try to form a pattern that resembles a shell of electrons composed of sets of four pairs to make an octet . Bigger atoms have many shells of eight , smaller ones may have only one ( or fewer than one complete shell ) but it 's only the outermost shell that really matters for bonding and chemical properties . When two elements bond , they share an electron or two to fulfil their octets . Different atoms as you go down a row of the periodic table have different numbers of valience electrons in their outermost shell . These are what make atoms react differently . Lithium , sodium , potassium , etc , have one atom in their outermost valience shell - that means they want to bond very much with something that can fill their shell . If you put sodium in water , it rips the water apart , and causes an explosion as the oxygen and hydrogen heat up . Likewise , flourine , chlorine , iodine , etc , all have seven electrons in their outer shell - they want badly to fill with things with only one electron , like hydrogen . That 's why these elements can make such powerful acids - it 's very easy for them to steal a hydrogen from water . Carbon has four electons . It ( and silicon , to a lesser degree ) is the whore of the elemnts . It loves to bond with a lot of stuff becuase there 's so many ways it can make pairs . Oxygen has six , so it loves to double bond ( share two pairs of electrons ) with carbon , or one each with hydrogen ( to make water . ) Finally the nobel gasses come complete with eight already . That 's why they hardly ever bond with * anything * . There 's more to this explanation than just that - radioactivity , transition elements , metals , different levels of valence shells , different types of bonds , subatomic forces , resonance , etc , but that is basically an entire chem course worth of information . But valence electrons are the most important thing overall .","The periodic table is full of patterns . The ' magic numbers ' of chemistry are * 2 * 2 + 6 = 8 * 2 + 6 + 10 = 18 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 = 36 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 + 18 + 18 = 54 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 86 Electrons travel in ' shells ' and it takes 2 to fill the first shell , 6 to fill the second , 10 to fill the third , 16 to fill the fourth , and 18 to fill shells the fifth / sixth / seventh shells . Atoms strongly ' like ' to have perfectly filled shells . If need be , they 'll share , give , or take electrons from other atoms to get perfectly filled shells . ----- The rightmost column made of Noble Gases . They already have perfect shells . For the most part , Noble Gas atoms do n't react with other atoms . The left - most column is alkali metals . They have perfect shells plus one extra electron .

The most common types of bugs are : 1 . A logic error . These are most often just mistakes made by the programmer . The mistake might be because the programmer had a momentary lapse of concentration or because they did n't quite understand something . For example , testing that two things are equal when the test should have been if they are * not * equal . 2 . Lack of or poor error handling . For almost everything that can be done in software , there are at least 3 other ways in which that might go wrong . Trying to write to a new file , for example , might fail if a file with that name already exists , if there are permission problems , if the disk is full or a quota is exceeded , if another program is simultaneously trying to write to the same file , if the file system has become corrupt , if the system is running out of memory and a whole host of other things . Handling these cases is an important part of writing a program , but because many of them rarely happen in practice and programmers can be lazy , they 're not handled correctly or at all . So most of the time the program works fine , but on the rare occasion when the disk is full , for example , the program does n't properly check for and handle that error and does something unexpected . 3 . Mismatching expectations from different programmers . Often programs contain code written by more than one programmer , and these different pieces of code must work together . Well engineered software is broken down into separate independent components that can be independently designed , implemented and tested . Sometimes when two components that appear to work fine independently are used together , something goes wrong . They might both be stepping on each other 's feet by fighting over the same resource or one might try to use the other , but expect it to work slightly differently from how it actually does . 4 . The programmer makes assumptions that are not necessarily true . They might be true on the programmer 's own system where the program works fine , but if the program is run on a different system , it might fail because the assumptions are no longer valid . For example , they might assume that another program is already installed , or that the OS is installed to the C:\\ drive .","Programming with no bug is essentially the same as telling stories with no kind of inconsistencies ( in the facts , the scenes , the thought patterns and emotions of characters , any kind of inconsistencies . ) For extremely short ones , that might be doable , though surprisingly hard . The biggest you get , the more unlikely it gets . Actually , one could say that a story with no inconsistencies is impossible . It is the nature of a story to sometimes trump expectations .

Sometimes, bugs are caused by mistakes in logic, where the programmer has written code that doesn't do what they intended it to do. \nIt can be difficult to create something without bugs because programming is a complex task that involves many steps and requires attention to detail. It is easy to make mistakes when writing code, especially if the programmer is working on a large and complex program.

In contrast, neutering is a relatively straightforward procedure that can often be performed under general anesthesia in a veterinary clinic setting. \nSecond, neutering is more effective at reducing unwanted behaviors in animals, such as aggression, marking territory, and roaming. This is because neutering removes the source of hormones (testosterone) that contribute to these behaviors. A vasectomy, on the other hand, only blocks the flow of sperm and does not significantly reduce the production of hormones. \nFinally, neutering is a more cost-effective option for pet owners, as it is generally less expensive than a vasectomy. \nOverall, while a vasectomy might seem more humane in theory, in practice it is usually a less practical and effective option for preventing unwanted pregnancies and modifying behavior in animals."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Hello again, little one!

That's because sugar can cause tooth decay, which is a process that happens when bacteria in your mouth use sugar from the foods you eat to make acids. These acids can attack your tooth enamel, which is the hard outer layer of your teeth. If the enamel gets weak or wears away, it can lead to cavities. \nWhen you eat or drink something with sugar in it, the bacteria in your mouth start making acid right away. The more sugar you eat or drink, the more acid they can make. So if you eat or drink a lot of sugar all at once, your teeth will be exposed to a lot of acid at once, which can be harmful. \nOn the other hand, if you have small amounts of sugar throughout the day, your teeth will be exposed to acid for a longer period of time, but the amount of acid they're exposed to at any given moment will be smaller. This can be less harmful to your teeth. \nIt's also important to remember to brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day to help remove sugar and plaque from your teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that can build up on your teeth and cause tooth decay. \nSo, to sum up: it's better for your teeth to have sugar in small amounts rather than all at once, and it's important to brush and floss your teeth to help protect them from sugar and plaque."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Sugar is like tiny monsters that like to eat your teeth and make holes called cavities.

{"question":"How is a place like Chernobyl uninhabitable due to radiation but Hiroshima is fine . What was the difference between the radiation in the two instances ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["There are a few of things that make Chernobyl still far more radioactive than Hiroshima and Nagasaki . First , the bombs actually did n't use very much radioactive material , all things considered . A nuclear reactor consumes much greater quantities of fuel than does a bomb , since the bomb is made to go BOOM and then be done with while the reactor needs a long , energetic , sustained reaction . Second , the fissile material in the atomic bombs was vaporized . I do n't mean that it disappeared , completely , but I mean was turned into plasma in the explosion . This pushed it much higher in the atmosphere and spread out the material over a huge distance . Without large concentrations , what little radioactive decay takes place over time ( remember that U235 and P239 have fairly long half lives and do n't release a ton of highly energetic particles when they do decay ) quickly became nominal compared to the standard background radiation . Third , very little of the fuel actually turned into the more dangerous radioactive intermediates . The percentages of the fuel actually consumed in those bombs is minute - more modern nuclear weaponry may leave longer lasting radiation . So that 's what happened in the bomb areas - Big releases of radiation at the time of explosion , but not much retained in the soil and region afterwards . In Chernobyl , on the other hand , large quantities of highly radioactive material were released into the atmosphere because of the heat from the fire generated . This includes radioactive steams ( heavy water ) , irradiated metals , intermediates , large quantities of spent and active fuels , the works . These were concentrated on the town , and were n't largely consumed in a big nuclear boom - most of those materials do n't actually go boom either . As a result of the varying half lives and the extremely large quantities of material in the area , it 's still very radioactive , especially near the core which got a logarithmically greater dose than the surrounding areas .","Firstly , one was a bomb , and the other was a powerplant . With the Hiroshima bomb , the nuclear reaction was a high yield , but quick acting nuclear explosion . Since the Chernobyl was a power plant , it was designed for longer lasting , but small yielding , nuclear reactions . Even after the incident , the nuclear core kept going and going , expelling more and more radiation . It is like a bomb that has been exploding for years rather than for a second .","Chernobyl is n't really uninhabitable . IIRC the other 3 reactors at the power plant stayed operational until 2002 .

This is a very good question , and people more knowledgeable than I will fully answer it for you . It just ( kind of ) grinds my gears that people ( not necessarily you ) think that more than 100k people died at Chernobyl and that its some giant green glowing crater . Check out the documentary Pandora 's Promise , a great film from former anti - nuclear activists who have now fully changed their minds due to thorough science .

The cells on the interior of the tumor die . There are two types of cell death : apopotosis , which is tightly regulated , and necrosis , which is unregulated . Unregulated dying , as is the case in tumor rot , causes a cell to release all of its contents onto neighboring cells , causing those cells to necrose as well . This usually results in the entire area to start decomposing , causing secondary bacterial infections and general gross - ness .

In reality , there are thousands of antigens present , but in terms of labeling RBCs , there are 3 important ones : A , B , and D ( Rh ) . A person with a certain antigen of these three would also have blood plasma ( surrounding liquid around RBCs ) containing antibodies ( bind to the antigens ) for the other blood types .

M works by modulating the amplitude of the signal according to the information being sent , while the frequency remains constant . This differs from FM technology in which sound is encoded by varying the frequency of the wave and the amplitude is kept constant . . This difference in signal type is what causes the sounds to change . AM has poorer sound quality compared with FM , but is cheaper and includes lower bandwidth making it ideal for having many stations in a small broadcast range .

The answer ? AM radio is more susceptible to interference than FM radio ( because there is not an easy way to distinguish between noise / interference and the desired signal ) AND the inter - station separation ( space between stations on the radio dial ) between AM radio stations is small enough that the full range of music is limited .","The first thing to understand is what the \" M \" means .

The actual music ( or talking ) is used at the radio station to change the constant nature of the carrier wave . This \" change \" is called modulation . It 's sort of \" mixed in \" .

They work by using a magnetic head to read and write magnetic signals on the tape. \nWhen you insert a VHS tape into a VHS player, the player's drive motor moves the tape past a series of spinning heads. These heads are magnetically charged and can read the magnetic signals on the tape. As the tape moves past the heads, the signals are converted into an electrical current, which is then amplified and played through the speakers of the VHS player. \nThe audio on a VHS tape is typically recorded in a format called \"analog audio,\" which means that the audio is stored as a continuous, wave-like signal on the tape. This is different from \"digital audio,\" which stores audio as a series of 1s and 0s.

I 'll attempt to explain it . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- You start off moving into what 's called Stage 1 , from being completely awake . When you first lay down to go to sleep , you pass from your awake state to what 's called Alpha state . You 've daydreamed before , right ? That 's basically Alpha state . You 're still mostly conscious , but you start to see some little bouts of color behind your eyes ( hypnogogic hallucinations ) and you start to feel more relaxed . After Alpha , you enter Theta state . Theta state is when you could technically be considered asleep . This is when you move completely into sleep paralysis ( have you felt like you were falling then woken up with a start ? that 's sleep paralysis setting in and you not being completely unaware when it happened ) . You 're still sleeping relatively lightly , but if you can get through this stage you move into deeper sleep . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The next major stage of sleep is called Stage 2 . Your brain starts to produce short periods of rapid brain waves that are called Sleep Spindles . This is the precursor to what comes next in sleep , deep sleep . Your body temperature begins to drop and your heart rate slows down , settling you in for the night . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ You then enter Stage 3 . When you enter stage 3 , really slow brain waves called Delta waves start happening . This is the true transition between light and deep sleep . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ You then enter Stage 4 .

You are the technically the most asleep in this stage . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Here 's where it gets interesting . There is another stage of sleep unlike all the others . It 's called Stage 5 , or REM sleep . REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement , your eyes literally start moving rapidly behind your eyelids .

{"question":"Why is the letter \" W \" pronounced \" double - u \" when \" double - v \" would seem to be more accurate ? Also , \" W \" is the only letter in the alphabet with more than one syllable . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["This goes back to the time when U and V were actually the same letter ; so , in fact , were I and J. This is what the classical Latin alphabet looked like : A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z But in handwriting , it looked a bit more like this : * a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u x y z * Notice that in the capital letters , there is no J or U ; and in the cursive letters , no * i * or * v * . Instead , you had the following capital / cursive pairs : I*j * and V*u * . So the name \" Julius \" would , in Latin , be carved in stone as \" IVLIVS \" , but written by hand as \" * juljus * \" . These letters could be used as vowels or consonants ; so the letter \" I \" as a vowel had a sound like the \" i \" in \" sit \" , and as a consonant a sound like the \" y \" in \" yes \" ; the letter \" V \" had as a vowel a sound like the \" u \" in \" put \" , and as a consonant ... well , it was either like our \" w \" , or like our \" v \" . The smart money is on \" w \" , but there were no tape recorders in those days so we ca n't be sure . But a word like \" * uacuum * \" might have been pronounced \" wack - woom \" , and explains why our word \" vacuum \" has two Us in it . The phrase \" * uenj ujdj ujcj * \" , which we usually spell \" veni vidi vici \" ( \" I came , I saw , I conquered \" ) might have been pronounced \" wenny weedy weeky \" or \" wenny weedy wee - chee \" ( again , we ca n't be sure ) . When the Roman alphabet was used to write other languages , those other languages often had sounds that did n't exist in Latin . Sometimes they added extra letters ( for example , the letters Ð and Þ , which are still used in modern Icelandic ) , sometimes they put two or more letters together to make a new sound ( for example , our TH ) . For some languages , a new letter was created by doubling the letter V -- so VV ; or , in cursive , * uu * . Hence the name , \" double - U \" . But additionally , the letters I and V were \" split \" , to make two versions of each -- originally , one for the vowel and one for the consonant . So the letter I*j * was split to make Ii for the vowel and Jj for the consonant ( which in modern English is now pronounced differently -- in modern German it 's still pronounced like our Y ) ; V*u * was similarly split to make Uu ( vowel ) and Vv ( consonant ) . The W took on the form of the V , but we kept the name \" double - U \" . This is actually appropriate , because the English \" w \" sound is , in effect , a very short \" u \" sound . Languages like French did n't originally have this letter , because it was n't needed -- except for writing foreign words , like \" le weekend \" . But since the W now looks like two Vs , the French called it \" double - V \" . Incidentally , although you might not think it , the sounds of \" W \" and \" V \" are , phonetically , very closely related . Native English speakers can hear the difference so clearly they do n't realise how similar they are ; many Germans , however , find it very difficult , and often confuse the sounds , saying \" wiolin \" instead of \" violin \" , for example . Both sounds are also very closely related to \" U \" .","Actually in several Other languages such as French and Spanish it is pronounced double - V ( or the French equivalent ) In reality the double - U pronunciation probable come from a handwriting variation where the W was actually written with a more curved bottom giving it a double - U look .

Upper ribs move more vertically ( think of the sternum as a well pump handle [ URL_0 ] , but with ribs coming off of it . That is the plane of movement of these ribs . So these ribs will be moving mostly up / down).The lower ribs have a more out and up sweeping type motion ( that is why when you inhale deeply the sides of your chest expand , because of this sweeping motion . ) There are a lot of muscles that interact with the ribs to facilitate this movement , most notably the diaphragm , but other muscles ( intercostals , serratus posterior , levator costorum , scaleneus ) act on the ribs to pull them up and down . Hope this helps","The areas between each rib are known as intercostal spaces and within these spaces are both interior and external intercostal muscles . Others have explained how they are connected to the vertebrae in the back and through hyaline cartilage at the sternum . Our ribs have a natural downward slope to them . The reason for this is so that when our external intercostal muscles contract with inspiration ( breathing in ) , the muscles physically raise the ribs to increase the size of the thoracic cavity by essentially just repositioning the ribs . This is possible because the connective tissue on the sternal end of the rib is hyaline cartilage which possesses elastic tendencies .

Race tires without treads make the most contact , but they are used only in the dry . Consumer tires have to handle multiple conditions , including water . The treads channel water away from the tires surface , allowing the tire to make contact with the road instead of floating on top of the water . Consumer tires have far less traction when \" bald \" usually due to heat cycling , and the fact the the compound at that level is often different than the compound at the surface when a tire is newer . Heat cycling is essentially the hardening of the rubber each time the tire warms up and cools down . The harder the tire , the less grip .

Some airports have made use of low ceilings in places where they do n't want people to linger , like the front of the check in line . edit : check in , not check out .","The greatest benefit to height is in the event of a fire . Higher ceilings allow more time for smoke and heat to accumulate before affecting things closer to the floor ( e.g. , people , fire load / combustibles ) . The height also can allow for fire suppression systems that cover a greater area with fewer components , such as sprinkler heads . In addition , it is generally easier to control the climate in a larger space with larger air volumes ( exchanges per hour ) that are not as noticeable in one spot . ( Except for those annoying freeze - or - fry areas where air flows are concentrated . ) The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building , either by exhaust or pressurizing the building ( negative and positive pressure ventilation , respectively ) . Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer ( higher ) columns required , which in turn need to be stronger because of ( typically ) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses . Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required . When designers are tasked to create ' open space ' , regardless of low or high ceilings , larger columns with stronger roof systems allow column spacing to be increased , thus ' opening ' the space . However , this is not always the case , such as in multi - story structures where significant weight / loads on higher floors require different column sizes or spacing ( e.g. , airports , parking ramps , hotels ) .

You once again use your house as collateral for the new loan and now have a mortgage with a different lender . People refinance to get better terms on their mortgage . If your original mortgage has an interest rate of 6 % but you can get a new one with a 4 % interest rate you can save money by refinancing . Reasons you may be able to get a lower interest rate include better credit on your part ( maybe your credit score rose since you took out the original loan ) or a better lending environment ( federal interest rates are low so banks are generally giving lower interest loans ) .","Basically you get a new loan under new terms to pay off the old loan . It 's typically done to get a lower interest rate or perhaps to change the lenght of the loan .","Shelter is expensive . There are basically three options to have shelter : * ( a ) Free shelter ( from someone else who is paying for it ) * ( b ) Rented shelter ( temporarily having possession of property that is owned by someone else ) * ( c ) Owned shelter ( the property is yours ) Let 's say Bob wants shelter . Charlie owns a home . If Bob wants to live in Charlie 's home , he may offer to pay rent every week / month in order to have permission to live inside of Charlie 's property . The relationship between Bob and Charlie is called a \" landlord - tenant relationship , \" and has its own laws and rules that each must follow . In the end , though , Bob is responsible for compensating Charlie for a % of the value Charlie has lost in his home ( because now he must share a part of it with Bob ) . This payment is a fraction of the value of Charlie 's home because Bob only enjoys a fraction of its benefit . One day , Bob decide 's he loves the home but dislikes living with Charlie . It so - happens that Charlie is looking to move to a different state . Charlie offers to sell his home to Bob for the \" fair market value \" ( what the average buyer would pay ) of his home : $ 200,000 . Like most people , Bob does n't have $ 200,000 , so he goes to find someone who does ( a \" lender \" ) . The Lender , usually a bank , has a lot of money and it makes money based on loaning it out to people . There is a cost to a loan . If a Lender gives you a $ 100 loan , due in a week , at 10 % interest , then in 1 week you will need to pay the Lender back $ 110 . In exchange for you having access to $ 100 immediately , the \" cost \" of the service was $ 10 . Here , the Lender will look at the potential deal between Bob and Charlie . They will see that Charlie has a house worth $ 200,000 , and Bob is willing to promise to buy it and pay for it over time . Using various calculations , risk assessments , and other economic factors , the Lender decides that Bob is worthy of a loan . It is common for Bob to have to pay at least a portion of the $ 200,000 ( 1 to 3 % ) , but the rest of that $ 200,000 will be paid from the Lender to Charlie on behalf of Bob . Once everything \" closes \" ( finalizes / goes through / is paid ) , Bob now owns Charlie 's house , * * subject * * to a mortgage owned by the Lender . In this case , Bob is paying $ X per month for 30 years with an interest rate of Y% . After 30 years , Bob will have paid well over $ 200,000 for the home ... how much over depends on the interest rate and his initial cash payment . Bob loves his house . He is making his mortgage payments , and life is good . In fact , 3 years later , there is a boom in the housing market and Bob 's house is now worth $ 400,000 . This means that if Bob were to sell his house today , he would be paid $ 400,000 and , from that , he would pay off the remainder of his loan to the Lender and make a profit of , say , $ 200,000 ( for the sake of keeping things simple ) . But what if Bob does n't want to sell the home ? That unrealized profit of $ 200,000 is called \" equity . \" Bob may want to \" cash - out \" on that $ 200,000 in equity in order to invest it in other stuff , which would require the Lender to agree to \" refinance \" ( modify ) the original agreement . Now , Bob owes $ 400,000 on his $ 400,000 home , but has received $ 200,000 cash . The most common reason to refinance , though , is a change in interest rates . Remember that when the Lender originally reviewed Bob for a loan , it made its offer based on many factors . Over time , those factors can change considerably . If , for example , the Lender had given Bob an interest rate of 10 % , but now interest rates are at 5 % , then it would save Bob a lot of money to negotiate with the Lender in order to reduce the interest rate to 5 % . Does the Lender need to ? No . Bob and Lender have an agreement already . However , if the Lender can figure out a way to increase its profit on the agreement ( for example , if the house is now worth more money ) , then it will be worth it to agree to receive less money in mortgage in exchange for a more valuable security . In other words ... remember how Lenders make money by lending money ? They do n't want Charlie 's house . So if Bob decided to immediately stop making payments on his mortgage after buying it , then the Lender would have been stuck with a $ 200,000 house that it paid about $ 200,000 for . But after 3 years when the house is worth $ 400,000 , if Bob stops making payments then the Lender has the ability to quickly recoup the money it is owed from the sale of the home , even if it has to sell it slightly below market value . So Refinancing provides a way for Bob to use the increased value of his property to reduce the cost of his loan to Lender because the increased value of the property also reduces the risk to Lender that it will be able to get the money it is owed . For the Lender , best case scenario = Bob pays the exact amount of money agreed upon within the time frame agreed upon . Worst case scenario = Bob fails to pay , but Lender will be able to sell the home to someone else that will pay that bill . * * tl;dr :* * Refinancing takes into account all the various factors that have changed since the time an agreement was originally made and adjusts the agreement in a way that is mutually beneficial to the borrower and the Lender ."],"chatgpt_answers":["When you refinance a house, you are essentially taking out a new loan to pay off your existing mortgage. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to get a lower interest rate, to change the length of the loan, or to access the equity you have built up in your home. \nHere's an example of how refinancing might work: \nLet's say that you have a mortgage on your home with an interest rate of 5%. You've been paying on this mortgage for a few years and have built up some equity in your home. Now, you find out that you can refinance your mortgage and get a new loan with an interest rate of 4%. This would mean that you would be paying less in interest each month, which would lower your monthly mortgage payments. \nTo do this, you would need to apply for a new mortgage and go through the process of getting approved for the loan. Once you have been approved, the lender will pay off your old mortgage and give you a new loan with the lower interest rate. You will then make payments on this new loan instead of the old one. \nOverall, refinancing a house can be a good way to save money on your mortgage payments or to access the equity you have built up in your home.

Rifled guns, on the other hand, are typically limited to firing kinetic energy projectiles. \nAnother reason is that smoothbore cannons can fire projectiles at higher velocities, which can be useful for defeating modern armor. This is because the smooth bore allows the projectile to maintain a higher velocity as it travels down the barrel, whereas the rifling in a rifled gun can cause the projectile to slow down slightly. \nFinally, smoothbore cannons are generally simpler and cheaper to manufacture, which can be an important consideration when designing military equipment. \nOverall, the choice between using a rifled gun or a smoothbore cannon in a tank often comes down to the specific role that the tank is intended to play and the types of threats it is likely to encounter.

This is because , when stopped , they have to rely on trim tanks ( which can pump water in and out ) to adjust the buoyancy to keep the submarine at completely neutral buoyancy , as any small difference will cause the submarine to slowly drift up or down . This tends not to be a very accurate process , plus you are then susceptible to any upwards or downwards currents . So typically submarines will maintain a very slow speed ( 1 - 3 knots , if memory serves ) when they want to hold position , because that allows them to use their dive planes ( the little wings that are on the sides of the submarine ) .

If a rubber seal were used in this case, the toilet might be too rigid and might crack or break if the floor moves. \nWax is a soft, pliable material that can create a good seal without being too rigid. It also has some stickiness, which helps it stay in place and prevents it from sliding around.

On ( 1 ) , the Senate had to approve a funding bill by Saturday night , otherwise the government would run out of money and have to shut down again .

These fibers are extremely thin, about the diameter of a human hair, and are made of a special type of glass or plastic that is very good at transmitting light. \nLight travels through the fiber optic cables by bouncing off the walls of the fibers.

Example : eating rare steak is fine , but chicken must be cooked all the way through Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The things you need to keep in mind are : * the structure of the meat i.e. how its cells are arranged . * the living environment of the original create e.g. caught in the wild , or raised on a farm . * the types of parasites / pathogens that the creatures are likely to be exposed to . The structure of the meat is important because it determines how easily / deeply any pathogen ( e.g. salmonella , e.coli ) can penetrate into the meat . For example chicken meat is basically a sponge . This means things like salmonella can penetrate deeply into the meat , which means you must cook the meat thoroughly in order to ensure safety ( the risk is low , but high enough to warrant this precaution ) . Beef on the other hand ( whole cuts at least ) are practically bulletproof as far as meats go . This is why you can have beef tartare , or steaks with barely a sear . The risk is comparatively much lower overall , and even if there is any harmful bacteria , it is unable to penetrate deeply into the meat - allowing you to quickly sear the meat and leave the center raw without any problems . This is also why you can easily dry age beef with few problems Ground / mince beef is technically riskier , but compared to most other meats the risk is very low ( hence tartare is on the menu ) . Fish , pork , and all wild meats can contain parasites ( with varying degrees of risk ) , which means extra care must be taken before safe consumption . Bear is so risky it is never eaten raw , while venison can be cooked to a lower temperature if handled properly beforehand . Raw fish is fine because most commercial sold fish is frozen beforehand to kill off any parasites . The same is done with pork generally , but because pork meat is still more \" spongy \" like chicken rather than \" layered \" like beef - you still have to cook thoroughly to remove the risk of bacterial contamination . Pork however can be safely dry cured when raw , as long as you use salt , sodium nitrite ( to prevent botulism ) , and the right environmental conditions ( temp / humidity ) for the cure to take place safely . Hence why you have salamis and serrano / prosciutto crudo ham . Overall - the important thing to remember is that * there is a reason * these recommendations exist * .

When meat is cooked, the heat kills the bacteria on the surface, so if the meat is cooked all the way through, it will be safe to eat. \nHowever, certain meats, such as chicken, turkey, and pork, can carry bacteria inside them, so it's important to cook them all the way through to kill any bacteria that might be present.

{"question":"Why is there a flu \" season \" ? If the flu is caused by a virus , why is it such a seasonal threat ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["I think it has to do with the fact that during flu season it is generally colder outside , which cause people to be indoors more . If everyone is inside , it increases the chances of coming in contact with someone who has the flu . I think My virology teacher said something like that . Also new flu shots are needed each year because influenza undergoes antigenic variation , which is a type of mutation .","The seasonal nature of the flu has not been established by research . The temperature is n't likely to have anything to do with it . Being colder does n't have a direct effect on the immune system , and nothing about warm weather will kill the flu virus . In fact there is similar seasonal fluctuation in tropical areas compared with temperate areas [ source ] ( URL_1 ) . Tropical flu epidemics have caused * controversy * over some of the hypotheses for why flu is seasonal including . * Dry air makes flu more transmissible * People are indoors and close together during flu season * Decreased vitamin D production during the winter weakens the immune system * Seasonal decrease in UV radiation may allow for survivability of the virus [ further reading ] ( URL_0 )","Disregard temperature and disregard people huddling together inside for a moment . First off , remember that the flu virus changes every single year . Yes , some years you may hear it 's mainly \" A \" or \" B \" or \" H1N1 , \" but the specific little virus changes every year . It 's not just making circles around the globe . 2013 's flu viruses did their damages , and eventually enough people developed immunity or died that it 's now gone . Aaaaaaaaand 2014 's is here . We 'll revisit this . Influenza largely comes from people living in close proximity with the two animals that can make flu happen : ducks and pigs . This does n't mean that people need to go slaughtering thousands of ducks and pigs like they were doing in 2009/2010 with the swine flu epidemic . It really just takes one pig , maybe a few , to pass along the virus to one human , maybe a few . So , farmers are the most likely to get it first and then spread it along . Once a farmer \" goes into town \" or just comes into contact with someone else who will \" go into town , \" a carrier is established , and it can spread quickly from there . Factor in airplanes , cars , trains , and before you know it influenza has made its way around the planet . Now , flu \" seasons \" vary by where you are in the world . You are most likely in North America , which is why you 're asking the question right now as opposed to a few months ago ( which would have lead me to believe you 're in Asia ) . This is because the flu always begins in Asia . Why Asia ? A couple reasons . There are many parts of Asia where humans farm large numbers of ducks and pigs , which provide the breeding ground for new flu viruses . Remember : new flu virus every year . Just like iPhones . Perhaps a better reason for Asia always getting it first , however , is the fact that the population on that continent is so huge . If you were to take all the humans on Earth , throw them into a bag , and randomly draw one out , you would be far more likely to have chosen someone who lives in Asia . After that , the flu * used to * spread at a predictable rate to South Asia , the Middle East , and North America almost simultaneously . Then Europe . Last was South America . I say \" used to \" because with the increase in global travel and the strange popularity of NOT getting vaccinated , the flu spreads pretty quickly these years . While South America still gets it last , it 's getting it sooner than usual ( used to be around March / April , now it 's more February / March ) . The reason you hear so much about it in North America is because it coincides with the Common Cold 's season . ( This , of course , simply happens when it 's cold outside , so a lot of the planet gets it at the same time ) . North Americans need the distinction made to them so that they do not think that they simply have the common cold and end up dying . This is why some Americans have a hard time being convinced that the \" Flu shot \" did them any good . They think , \" I got the shot last year and still got sick ! \" But what they really got sick with was the common cold , which shares a handful of symptoms with Influenza . So summertime finally comes around and all the people who were exposed to Influenza either had protection in the form of a vaccine ( Woo Hoo ! ) , picked it up but were able to develop enough antibodies for immunity , or just died . :( Then the cycle begins anew . I 'm sorry if this was long - winded , but if anything , please get your fucking flu shot as soon as it 's available . Not even at your earliest convenience ; * make time * for it . I want to add at this point that although it 's one form of the virus that usually does the most damage , our planet 's doctor 's develop a quadrivalent vaccine each year to protect against the four most likely ( or known ) strains that year . So you could catch someone 's Type A flu in California and survive it , then vacation to Florida and get fucked by H1N1 shortly thereafter .

The doctor will give you one pill to swallow in office ( this effectively kills the fetus ) and then you take home another prescription of misoprostol . It can be taken bucally ( lined along your gums and allowed to dissolve over time ) or vaginally ( inserted with a finger or tampon but must stay laying down for 2 - 4 hours so they do not exit your vagina ) . This send the uterus into contractions like when you have your period . This will be much heavier than your normal period . You will pass huge blood clots . The next day , you will have to take those same 4 pills again to ensure that your uterus has pushed everything out . Followed by a checkup in two to three weeks to make sure you got everything out . You will still test positive on a pregnancy test for 1 - 5 weeks because they hormones take their time going back to normal . So it 's important to see a Dr for follow up . The next version is surgical which is a d & c. They will give you a medicine that is used to soften and open your cervix . They will also inject novacaine or lidocaine to minimize pain . The procedure lasts no more than 2 - 5 minutes . They enter your uterus and scrape the walls and suck it out with a vacuum like machine . It is done in one sitting and can be verified that day that the abortion is complete . They only do these on 8 - 15 weeks . Unless it 's medically required .

There are different ways to have an abortion, and the method used can depend on how far along the pregnancy is and other factors. \nOne way to have an abortion is with medication. This can be done during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. The person seeking the abortion takes two different medications. The first one, called mifepristone, is taken at a doctor's office. This medication makes it so the pregnancy cannot continue. A few days later, the person takes a second medication called misoprostol at home. This medication causes the uterus to contract and empty, which ends the pregnancy. \nAnother way to have an abortion is with a procedure called aspiration or suction abortion. This can be done during the first 16 to 20 weeks of pregnancy. During the procedure, a healthcare provider uses special instruments to remove the pregnancy from the uterus. The provider may use local anesthesia to numb the area and prevent pain. \nThere are other types of procedures that can be used to end a pregnancy, but these are the most common. \nAfter an abortion, the pregnancy tissue (including the fetus) is usually removed from the body. In some cases, the tissue may be examined to make sure the abortion was successful and to check for any complications. \nIt's important to note that abortion is a safe and legal medical procedure.

{"question":"why are dentists their own separate \" thing \" and not like any other specialty doctor ? Why do I have separate dental insurance ? Why are dentists totally separate from regular doctors ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Finally , my time to shine . Dentist here . Dentistry for the most part developed as a skilled trade . The field has resisted attempts to integrate into medicine throughout its history . Initially , dental training was spotty at best and it did n't take much for somebody to claim they were a dentist . For example , Paul Revere advertised his skills as a dentist in addition to his other trade as a silver smith . There were \" dentists \" in the 18th century that were self proclaimed but branched out into dentistry after receiving a medical education , but that was not the norm . In the US , beginning in the 1840 's , dentists began to lobby the state government ( in Alabama of all places ) to allow dentists to sit on the state medical board and license dentists to practice . This did n't really begin to be enforced with any regularity until the turn of the 20th century . Many dentists that I know do not think that the two professions should merge ( as in everyone goes to medical school and then make dentistry a residency program after getting your MD ) . The claim is that there 's so much specialized knowledge in Dentistry that it would be a waste of time to spend years on rotations through the other hospital wards when you could be studying advanced periodontics or removable or whatever else . My personal opinion is that many dentists resist the change because of a fear in the reworking of the payment structure into one more similar to the HMO model that dominates general medicine . Right now HMO practice is big in dentistry but there 's still plenty of PPO plans and cash paying patients that the compensation is good , and for the most part an insurance company is n't telling you how to practice . There 's also quite a bit of territorial feelings when it comes to dentistry . Dentists tend not to like it when they feel their \" turf \" is threatened .

We both took anatomy in the same lab for a full year but most of our year focused intensely on head and neck with the rest of the body 's main vessels , nerves , muscles , etc . while hers was detailed on the whole body with less focus on the head and neck than ourselves . Our paths diverge from that course on . As dentists we learn all general diseases , treatments , medicine and pathology in various courses . We can converse in them and understand them and understand how they affect the mouth and the interconnection between them all . We prescribe medications , administer drugs ( sedatives , nitrous , antibiotics , narcotics , etc . ) and must be responsible for their effects and interactions with other diseases , illnesses , and drugs . As dentists we have rigourous training in a multitude of areas : root canals , fillings , crowns , bridges , surgery , anesthesia , implants , pathology or mouth diseases , cancer , tumours , cysts , cosmetics , dentures , etc .

{"question":"What happens to the data deleted on our computers / phones / devices ? I always assumed the device just farted out the data we deleted . I am curious as to what exactly happens . How is it removed from our devices ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The data is on your hard drive and when you delete it , your computer allows the data to be overwritten .","It is n't removed . The device only deletes the access information and now says the actual files are blank space , in reality they are still there . Until , you add new files that use that same space . With certain programs you can still access all those pics , videos , and docs you thought you deleted . If you keep lots of blank space on your device , chances are everything is still there . If you are constantly having to delete files to make room for more , those files may actually be gone .","# # What is a File System ? Imagine your computer as a recipe book . It contains sections , such as \" * Cakes * \" , \" * Soups * \" or * \" Stews * \" which represent directories , and within each section are individual recipes , which represent the files on your computer . So you have a list of sections ( directories ) each of which contains a list of recipes ( files ) . The contents page contains a table which tells you on which page you can find each section and each individual recipe . This is like your file system , which is essentially a big table which tells the operating system on which part of the disk it can find each directory and file . With a recipe book , you can easily flick through the book to find things without looking through the contents , but on a computer that 's quite a bit harder because there are so many files : often hundreds of thousands or even millions on a single system . So on a computer , the file system is , for all intents and purposes , the only way to find files and directories . The act of * formatting * a disk with a specific file system is what actually creates a file system , which is like an empty contents table . It gives you a place where you can insert your recipes ( files ) and sections ( directories ) . ---- # # Deleting files What happens when you delete a file or a directory on a computer is that the entry in the file system is simply removed . It 's like just crossing out the entry for an individual recipe in the contents page of the recipe book . Notice that the actual recipe is still in the book , and you can still find it if you scan through the book looking for it . This is how undelete programs are able to recover deleted files ; they can search for the file on the disk and re - insert the entry back into the file system just like re - adding an entry for a recipe back into the contents table . So you 've removed the entry for a recipe from the contents , but what happens to the actual page on which your deleted recipe resides ? Well , the recipe is still on it , but it 's considered to be a free page now . This is where the analogy kind of breaks down , because obviously pages in a book ca n't just be written over , but parts of a disk can be . So a part of the disk containing the contents of a file which no longer has no entry in the file system is considered free to use . It 's just data that no longer belongs to anything . When you want to create a new file , that piece of the disk can be reused and new data can be written to it . --- # # Secure Deletion Secure delete programs will actually attempt to overwrite the data on the disk before removing the entry from the file system . In actual fact , this does n't always work because when you write new data to a file , it does n't necessarily reuse the same location on the disk , but that 's another topic entirely ."],"chatgpt_answers":["When you delete a file from your computer, phone, or other device, the data is not immediately erased.

Is it just the governments keeping these peoples separate ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["This is a huge question . The \" major \" difference is that Hong Kong and Taiwan are more traditionally Chinese ( pre - Cultural Revolution ) , but with a tiny bit of Japanese influence from WWII occupation . ( Hong Kongers and Taiwanese are , at least , less likely to viscerally hate Japanese . ) In fact , Hong Kong and Taiwan have more in common with some overseas ( i.e. American ) Chinese communities than with the Mainland Chinese . Naturally , Hong Kong has a lot of British influence ( people queue up ) , while Taiwan has some Native Taiwanese ( essentially Polynesian ) influence . Also , check out Macau -- the former colony of Portugal .","Native Taiwanese here . In simple terms , everything started with the difference in government and the cultures divided accordingly . To start off , Taiwan is a true democratic government with it 's own president , a bunch of political parties and complete freedom of stupid speech .

You can ( attempt ) to monopolize businesses and do whatever you want with your money and have as many kids as you want just like any other civilized 1st world country ( marriages are still restricted to monogamy ) . We can read whatever we want , watch whatever TV , shows and movies we want , and travel / immigrate to anywhere in the world we wish at any time . What all of this means is that if you 've ever met a Taiwanese person who spoke good enough English , you probably could n't tell whether he grew up in the USA or otherwise . China 's government on the other hand controls a lot of things . The single birth law should be common knowledge already , and many people flee the country once they know they 're pregnant with a second baby . I 've also heard of people being denied student visas simply because the officials had ' classified ' reasons against them leaving the country despite them being 100 % law abiding citizens . Recently there 's also been a crackdown on foreign accounts and everyone 's personal bank accounts are on probation . My friend who recently moved here to the US recently said her life savings are on lockdown and she is n't allowed to do withdrawals from this side of the planet nor carry large amounts out in person . Gmail is banned , Facebook is banned , Youtube is banned , Twitter is banned , PORN is banned , possessing weed is punishable to the equivalent of selling heroine in the USA , and the government STRONGLY promotes atheism above any other religion . Guess what all of this does for the moral integrity of the people ? That 's right , it does nothing . Cheating is a sport , divorce is a rising trend and prostitution is at an all time record high . Not really a country I would consider settling and raising kids in . One other major cultural difference is the writing system . Simplified Chinese created by the government during the Cultural Revolution to prevent people from going ELI5 about the history of the language , and it did a good job at that . Pinyin is NOT Chinese . How the hell does a 5000 year old non Latin language suddenly start using the English alphabet to spell out it 's characters ?

Finally , Hong Kong is basically what would happen to Taiwan if China were to assimilate it .

This type of light is called ultraviolet light, or UV light for short. UV light has a shorter wavelength than the light that we can see with our eyes, which is why it appears black to us. \nThere are different ways to create UV light. One common way is to use a special type of bulb or lamp called a black light bulb. These bulbs contain a chemical called phosphor, which is a substance that emits UV light when it is excited by electricity. When electricity passes through the phosphor, it causes the phosphor to emit UV light. \nAnother way to create UV light is by using a device called a black light flashlight. These flashlights use a special type of LED (light emitting diode) that is designed to emit UV light. \nUV light is used in many different applications, such as for sterilizing surfaces in hospitals and laboratories, detecting fake currency, and creating special effects in stage lighting and nightclubs. \nI hope this helps to explain how black light is made!

For example, if a plane is too high up or too far from the water, it might not have enough time or distance to safely glide down to the surface. Additionally, the water might not be smooth enough for a safe landing, or there might be obstacles such as ships or buildings in the way. \nSometimes, planes do crash land on water and there are survivors. The Hudson River landing that you mentioned, where Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger safely landed a plane on the Hudson River in New York City, is a famous example of this. In that case, the plane was able to land on the water because it was at a low altitude and there were no obstacles in the way. The passengers and crew were also able to evacuate the plane quickly and get to safety. \nHowever, in many cases, planes that crash land on water do not have survivors. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the impact of the crash is too severe, if the plane sinks before the passengers and crew can get out, or if the water is too cold or rough to survive in. It's also important to remember that not all plane crashes happen on water – many happen on land, and the chances of survival can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the crash."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, crashing onto water is not always easy because the plane may hit the water too hard, causing it to break apart or flip over.

December 21st is the winter solstice -- which has to do with the position of the sun in the sky not the length of the day . Also , the winter solstice sometimes falls on the 22nd . Secondly , and to answer the question : it DOES get warmer immediately following the shortest day . However the air temperature that you experience in January and February is artificially cooler if you have land to the west of you . Mountains with snow pack , frozen lakes , and snow piles in parking lots all combine to steal heat from the air as they melt -- lowering the temperature in January and February . As evidence of this , look at the 100 - year median temperatures of Seattle and Los Angeles -- which upturn immediately after their respective \" shortest days \" . Because the Pacific does n't have frozen patches , it absorbs heat from the air uniformly . Thus the air temperature in those coastal cities are protected from the extremes and you can see on the graph that the coldest days are the shortest days . BTW , there are places on the Earth where for a few weeks a year there is no night at all . It 's called Midnight Sun .","Temperature is not only controlled by the amount of heat added by the sun , the Earth and the surface ocean also contribute to the temperature of the air . As the air gets colder and Autumn turns to Winter , the amount of solar incidence decreases but the heat lost from land and water mitigates the drop in temperature somewhat . On Dec 21 , solar incidence is at its minimum but there is still heat coming off the earth . Solar incidence begins to increase , but he earth gives off less and less heat ( as it is now cooler ) . Eventually , the earth cools enough so that it is at equilibrium with the atmosphere , but solar incidence is increasing , reversing the process through the summer ."],"chatgpt_answers":["I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You are correct that December 21 is the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. \nThe length of the day, or the amount of time between sunrise and sunset, changes throughout the year because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. On December 21, the North Pole is tilted farthest away from the sun, which is why it's the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. \nAfter December 21, the days will start to get longer again. However, the weather doesn't change immediately because the Earth's atmosphere and oceans take time to warm up or cool down. It takes some time for the warmer weather to reach the surface of the Earth, so even though the days are getting longer, it may still be cold for a while. \nI hope this helps!

{"question":"Why does the exchange rate between countries fluctuate so much ? What causes the rise and fall of exchange rates and why ca n't we just have a constant rate ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["It 's actually not that complicated . I 'll give an example ( i have many of them like demand / supply and import /export driven etc , but I 'm on my phone so I 'll give you only one ) . For simplicity , Let 's assume my nation of 10 citizens uses a stone chip as a currency and your nation of 10 citizens uses glass chips . And we start off trading on 1 stone chip equals 1 glass chip . Now imagine , My nation some how found itself in a depression and decided to pick up few more stones from the ground and decided to call it money . ( like the Fed reserve prints money out of thin air ) . So every one in my nation has plenty of those stones already ( worthless at this point ) . Would you still sell me your 5 glass chips worth of product for 5 stone chips ? I.e. We could easily bankrupt you by taking your products and hand you worthless stone chips . Edit : for clarity","It 's all about how much people will pay in one currency for another currency . In some ways , currencies are like stock shares in the issuing country . You might consider the total amount of money that exists in a given currency as the market capitalization of the country . Shares / currencies rise and fall in value relative to other shares / currencies as public opinion changes about the long - term stability of the company / country . The Yen and Ruble have been falling relative to the dollar lately because the prevailing opinion of the stability of the Japanese and Russian economies is faltering . The US economy appears to finally be strengthening again , so people holding Yen and Rubles would rather sell short to get into Dollars than hold those currencies and wait for them to rise again .","Flexibile exchange rates are determined by the world 's demand and supply for the given currency . Individual people , investors , firms , and governments all demand a certain amount of a country 's currency at a point in time and that country will supply a certain amount of that currency . If the supply of the currency remains constant ( i.e. their central bank does not print more of it ) and more people decide that they want to buy more of the currency , the currency will appreciate and it will become more expensive to purchase . The opposite happens if people decide they do n't want the currency anymore and decide to sell it . A flexible exchange rate is important for many countries because it can act as a tool the central bank can use to help out the domestic economy if the economy is too heated or if it is in a recession . Because the central bank manipulate 's the interest rate in the domestic economy , they indirectly manipulate the demand for the domestic currency and thus indirectly affect exports and therefore aggregate demand . How does this happen ? Say , for example , the US is going into a recession . The Federal Reserve can then lower the interest rate in the American economy . When this happens , many of the American bonds investors can choose from will now have a lower interest rate which means they are not as valuable compared to other bonds in the world , say Canadian bonds ( holding all else constant ) . Investors will then decide to sell their American bonds ( or not buy any at all ) and sell American currency so they can exchange it for Canadian currency and invest in Canadian bonds which have a higher rate of return and are more profitable . The act of investors selling American currency causes the supply of American currency to increase , and if we hold the demand constant , the American currency will then be worth not as much . If American currency is not worth as much , American goods and services will be relatively cheaper , so foreigners will demand more American goods and services because they are cheaper relative to other foreign goods from other countries . The result is that the American economy begins to export more goods , and this means more jobs in the American economy , and so the economy will begin to heat up again and the impact of the recession will be smaller ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Exchange rates fluctuate because they are determined by the supply and demand for different currencies. The exchange rate is the price of one country's currency in terms of another country's currency. When the demand for a particular currency is high, its value will increase, and the exchange rate will go up. When the demand for a particular currency is low, its value will decrease, and the exchange rate will go down. \nThere are many factors that can affect the supply and demand for a particular currency, such as the strength of a country's economy, political stability, and interest rates. For example, if a country has a strong economy and stable political situation, people and businesses around the world may want to buy its currency, which will increase demand for it. This will cause the value of the currency to go up and the exchange rate to increase. \nIt is not possible to have a constant exchange rate because the factors that affect the supply and demand for different currencies are always changing. For example, a country's economy may strengthen or weaken, or its political situation may change. These changes can affect the demand for its currency and, in turn, the exchange rate. \nI hope this helps to explain why exchange rates fluctuate.

This process helps to create a very sharp edge on the knife, but it also makes the blade thinner and weaker. \nAs we continue to sharpen the knife, the blade will eventually become so thin and weak that it will break or chip when we try to use it.

{"question":"Why those students were killed in Mexico ? Purposes ? I ca n't figure out why all this is happening in Mexico around those students missing . Can you explain that to me , excuse my lack of knowledge . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["At this point it is presumed the students , who were activists , were traveling to protest at a meeting where the mayor 's wife was to give a speech . So , he had his cops stop their bus and arrest them . They were then turned over to the local Drug Lord for disposition . The rest , as they say , is history .","There 've been a lot of answers regarding what happened to the students and why . And most of them are correct , but I thought I 'd share a little more context regarding the background of the students . They were studying to become teachers in what is known in Mexico as a * Escuela Normal*(a school for future teachers ) hence the name that has been given to them * normalistas * roughly translated into aspiring teachers . This next paragraphs may piss someone off if taken out of context .

Evidence : [ photo 1 ] ( URL_0 ) [ photo 2 ] ( URL_1 ) This specific * Normal * in Ayotzinapa was n't the exception , with murals of Lenin , Che , Marx , Engels and Mexican guerrilla figures of the 70s . As the majority of extreme left wing activists in Mexico they are very rowdy , and sometimes become violent . Which pisses of the authorities , especially extreme authoritarian ones like in this town , so they pissed off the mayor 's wife . and the rest has been explained to you already . So basing myself on previous clashes between Mexican police and rowdy activists , when the students are detained , the police gets all \" Oh so who 's the bitch now ? \" , \" You 're not so tough now are you ? \" \" You 'll get what you deserve \" Again , like a truly authoritarian regime . What happened in Ayotzinapa was a pretty fucked up event , that borders on genocide . But want to know one of the reasons they were protesting ?

{"question":"Why Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is called \" the greatest game of all time \" Please try to be objective . Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Awesome Master Sword , time travel , zombies , cool ocarina songs , seeing yourself grow up , horse riding , epic battles , having your own fairy , using a grappling hook , epic shielding of things , horse carrots , fishing , the Goron race , nostalgia , and fucking with chickens .","The ELI5 answer is because many people played the game and found it to be their favorite . That answer is perhaps a bit to pithy , though , and so I 'll go with a slightly different version . This requires that I start with two assumptions . First , that the OP does not agree with this ranking and second that the OP did not play it when it first arrived nearly two decades ago . Making a list of best games is a trying task . In 30 years , we 've gone from Super Mario Brothers to Far Cry 4 and on every level modern games have improved . They have more complex graphics , more focus on a wider variety of facets including narrative and mechanics and generally are the result of decades of advancement and decades of trial and error . Thus your average game released now represents improvements in most of not all areas when compared to a game from decades past . So , why is it that the top lists of games is n't absolutely dominated by brand new stuff ? For the same reason the list of top movies is not dominated by films made in the last few years . You do n't compare a modern movie to an ancient movie directly - the only thing that would achieve is seeing how film has changed and you do n't compare a modern game to an ancient one directly either . Instead , they are viewed relative to the time in which they existed . When Ocarina of Time came out , it was easily the best Zelda game . At the time , it had a striking and beautiful art style , well thought out mechanics , a greater focus on story and was simply vastly superior to just about everything else at the time . This made for a game that was instantly beloved by just about everyone who played it and it earned this by being a game so far ahead of its peers that the formula has remained all but identical ever since . Thus the ELI5 answer is that many people think that relative contemporary stuff , Ocarina of Time is the best game . We can look at this a different way though by looking at a different game . Consider the classic PC game Baldur 's Gate 2 : Shadows of Amn and compare it to Dragon Age : Origins . There are many broad similarities between the two and , as you might expect , Dragon Age shows broad refinement at every level . And yet Baldur 's Gate generally is placed above Dragon Age because , at the time , Baldur 's Gate 2 's real competition was Baldur 's Gate 1 . Thus while Baldur 's Gate 2 is inferior when directly compared to Dragon Age , in context it is quite the opposite . In the decade after Baldur 's Gate 2 , lots of RPGs came and went that all learned important lessons from Baldur 's gate and so Dragon Age is much less remarkable than it 's spiritual predecessor . Much like the first movie with audiable dialog is hugely fascinating because it was something new and exciting games are often remembered fondly when * they * drag the medium forward . Ocarina of Time was a game that did more than drag the medium forward - it picked it up and ran and * that * is why the game is fondly remembered . The problem with this , of course , is that without experiencing the thing in context , you can really only understand such a thing academically .","First off , its important to understand that \" the greatest game of all time \" is completely subjective and a large amount of people disagree that OoT holds that position ( some even argue that Majora 's Mask is better ) . The reasons people WOULD hold that position are : 1 . Great gameplay . The entire idea of Z - targeting was fairly new i think , so it was a cool way to transition to 3D and make fighting viable and less clunky . It also maintained the \" Zelda feel \" with the items and temples . 2 . Well made story and lore . Compared to Twilight Princess or even Windwaker , Ocarina 's story is n't involved at all , but compared to what came before it was in depth . There is a lot of lore about all of the races that are interesting , and the time travel aspects are interesting and drive the plot to places you would n't expect from a normal adventure game . 3 . Change to 3D. Realize that there were only 3 Zelda games out before Ocarina , all in 2D. The fact that their first 3D was so successful and well made is pretty impressive . Note that all 3D Zelda games ( other than Skyward Sword in a couple places ) use the same formula and gameplay as Ocarina of Time , and are all successful . Without Ocarina those games would n't have existed , or have been completely different at least . 5 . Music . While it does n't seem like music is really that important in the grand scheme of things , OoT did something unique : they tied in music with gameplay . All of the songs in OoT actually have an attached meaning to memories of the game , and the fact you replay songs over and over get them stuck in your thoughts . Its a unique thing that video games can accomplish but is n't necessarily used . It makes the game more memorable and meaningful . Every time you play Zelda 's Lullaby is a reminder to the player about what 's at stake and your promise to the princess , every teleporting song sets the mood for the place you 're going to , etc etc . You could probably write an entire paper just on this topic alone . 4 . Nostalgia . Personal experience is important in value arguments , and a lot of people will view what they played in their childhood as better than what s out now . This does n't mean that Ocarina of Time is a bad game or is worse than all of the other Zelda games , its just a factor that plays into people 's opinions . Personally I think its all of that , plus the uniqueness of Zelda games in general . They play like a fairy tale and appeal to the inner kid . Its hard to sit down with a Zelda game and not feel happy just because the tone of the games are so adventurous and exciting . Not many games can nail that as well as Zelda has . There is no definitive \" Greatest Game of All Time \" , just like there is no equivalent for movies or books , but I would say there is enough reason to consider it at least in the top 10 or 20 . TLDR ; Ocarina of Time has a surprisingly immersive world and fluid gameplay , all built during the initial transition to 3D , which makes its success very impressive ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a video game that was released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64 console.

{"question":"Why do electric cars have 1 forward gear whereas gas engine cars have multiple forward gears ?

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Gas engines have a much narrower effective range of speeds . They need the gearing advantage to get the car moving from a stop , and they need overdrive gears to cruise comfortably . Electric motors are capable of making enough torque from start without gearing , and can cruise comfortably without an overdrive gear .","Engines are generally hooked up to drive shafts , which spin at whatever rate the engine is turning over . When you see engine RPMs , this is revolutions per minute - the speed with which this shaft is rotating . If the drive shaft is hooked directly up to a wheel , that is a single speed transmission . The wheel will turn at whatever speed the engine is turning over . Gasoline engines are powered by pistons and cylinders . ( Detailed description : URL_1 ) . The faster the pistons are firing and the faster the engine is turning over , they higher the physical stresses on the engine components . Your typical car maxes out at 6000 - 7000 RPMs , after which you risk damage to the little bits that connect the cylinders to the drive shaft . Stronger components can allow the engines to turn over more rapidly . Some race cars limit is more like 13,000 RPMs , but at some point if you want to go faster you need to reduce the speed with which the engine rotates . This is accomplished by changing the gear , which changes the ratio between engine and wheel rotation so that the engine can remain within it 's operating range and the wheels can spin at the speed with which the vehicle is moving . Gas engines are also more efficient at lower RPMs , and produce more power at high RPMs , so you need some way to alter the RPMs of the engine depending on what you need the car to do . If you 're travelling at a constant 50 mph , you want your engine to be turning at something like 1500 RPMs ( the most efficient speed will vary based on the engine and vehicle ) . If you want to speed up to 70 mph to pass , you need the engine to be able to be running at 4000 RPMs at 50 mph to accelerate quickly . Thus , gears . Electric engines have no pistons . They ( usually ) have a single moving part which is turned by using a magnet inside an electric field . As the electric field is rotated , the magnet turns to align with the field . The speed with which the engine can turn only limited by the speed with which the magnet can rotate . Electric engines also produce almost the same power and torque at almost any RPM . There are limitations based on the rotation of the electric field , magnet , etc , so you will need another gear for extremely fast cars , but for passenger vehicles the entire range of possible speeds can be covered without altering the gear .

It shoots a laser to a prism which is usually mounted on the end of a pole that the survey assistant holds , then reads the distance and elevation distance between the total station and the prism . This produces very accurate measurements ( within millimeters ) . You can also mount prisms anywhere to record ongoing movements . When there is a guy holding a pole with a keypad and a little round dome on the top of the pole , that 's GPS . GPS is quicker and easier but the accuracy is n't as good ... around 10 cm . So for example , total station would be used to lay out stakes for building corners or foundations . GPS is commonly used for topographic surveys for large projects and roads since its way quicker and tolerances are n't as crucial as a building . If you want to build a new road , for example , you would send surveyors out to do a topographic survey that would include recording locations and elevations of every object around ... signs , fences , trees , other roads , culverts , etc . Topographic is recording many points in a grid pattern across the ground so you have a record of the ground surface so that you can re create a model of the ground surface with a computer- this is where drafters / designers come in . Once you have a model of the ground you can design the road . You need all this info for both the vertical alignment of the road ( the height or elevation of the road ) and horizontal alignment ( where the road goes , where there are curves etc . ) the topographic data helps designers decide on a few things , mainly the height of road for cut / fill balance as well as maintaining drainage . Cut / fill balance is looking at the variations in ground surface and determining the ideal road elevation so that you have a good balance of areas where you need to cut ( excavate material out ) or fill ( place and build up material ) . If you do n't have cut / fill balance , you would end up with either having to cut or fill too much and haul material for longer distances , which costs big money . Next time you 're driving down a highway through a hilly area , pay attention to the structure of the roadway embankment compared to the surrounding ground . When the road goes up and over a hill , you can usually look towards the top of the hill and on either side of the road , the ground surface will slope up , and the road height is lower than the top of the hill on either side . You can imagine what the hill would have looked like before the road was built ... they \" cut \" material out to get the road elevation down in order to ensure the road is nt too steep . On the flip side , when a road goes through a valley , the ground on the sides of the road slopes down until it meets the valley floor . This roadway embankment is a fill . Similarly , done to maintain proper grades along the road . There is a transition point between cut / fill when the road comes out of a valley and approaches a hill . Good cut / fill balance means the road is cut into the hill enough so that you can use the excavated material to fill in the embankment on either side of the hill . Cut too much and you end up with too much dirt , which is a waste of cash . Cut too little , you have to haul in dirt from another location . Lots of times you 'll see sloughs along highways through flat sections ... these are usually borrow pits to obtain fill material . All this is determined based on the topographic survey . Then once your road is designed in the computer model , you pick out a bunch of points from the model , give the list of points to a surveyor and they go put stakes in the ground that show the alignment of the road so the contractors know exactly where to work . Stakes will usually have a station number like 0 + 500 which means 500 m from a pre determined point , like maybe an intersection . 1 + 050 would be 1 km plus 50 m. I do n't know why they use that format . Then you will have a cut / fill value like + or - 0.35 , sometimes with an arrow pointing to a line on the stake or to the ground surface . +0.35 means at that point , 0.35 m of fill is required . -0.35 of course means you need to remove 0.35 m of material . As construction proceeds , the surveyors will continually check to make sure the elevations and locations of the road are correct . They will also replace stakes that get knocked over by machinery , which is common . Sometimes in areas of significant cut you 'll see little columns of dirt with a stake on top . This is done to maintain the stake so the surveyors do n't have to return as often . Survey stakes are called \" lath . \" Do n't know why they call them that . The designers also look at the elevations in ditches and make sure the slope is sufficient so water will drain properly . They will put culverts where needed as well , again , based on the topo data . These concepts can be applied to any construction project .","They are measuring and making records of exactly where things are in relation to each other , so that accurate maps and diagrams can be drawn , and so the boundaries between properties can be effectively located .","The equipment I believe your referring to is a \" theodolite \" , also called a \" total station \" . It it a range / angle finding tool that can measure three different distances ( horizontal , vertical , and slope ) , as well as the two different angles ( azimuth , and slope ) Imagine a cross - section of a hill where the hypotenuse is the surface of the hill , the length of which is the slope distance ; the horizontal distance is the bottom leg of the triangle and the vertical distance is the opposite leg . The theodolite shoots a laser into a passive tool called a \" prism \" that reflects the laser back at it and calculates the distance . The azimuth angle is usually taken from some fixed point due north , and this allows you to find the angles for an entire parcel of land without using a protractor or something equally inaccurate and inefficient . The slope angle is just the angle at which the hill is inclined or declined . While theodolites are usually the most common method of surveying , the same can be accomplished without such an advanced piece of equipment by using an auto - level and a high rod . The auto - level is appears to be a telescope , but the distinguishing difference is that the auto - level has a series of wire suspended mirrors within the tube that ensure the surveyor only ever looks purely horizontal from wherever they are . This is used in conjunction with a high - rod , a really long stick with markings every inch or so , to determine vertical distance between two points .

To understand why people \" deny the holocaust \" , you have to actually look at their arguments and evidence rather than instantly dismissing them as crazy or stupid as most of the comments here would have you believe . The term \" Holocaust deniers \" is also a very misleading term , as the vast majority of these people do not actually deny that the holocaust happened - in the sense that they do not deny that Jews were put in camps , and that many died . Rather , they instead dispute the circumstances and details of this incredibly politicized historical event and come to a different interpretation . From what I understand , Holocaust revisionists generally deny that the Nazi Concentration camps were designed to systematically exterminate people , and claim the \" death camps \" were actually initially designed as political internment camps , similar to [ camps in the USA for Japanese citizens in WW2 ] ( URL_0 ) . They often mention the Auschwitz swimming pool , Orchestra , theater , sports - field and art activities and ask why they were built for , and used by people who the Nazi 's intended to simply exterminate . They reference eyewitness quotes and testimony to support their claims(For example , from [ videos like this ] ( URL_1 ) ) . Revisionists also point to the design of the camps , using the blueprints as being clearly ( in their opinion ) , inefficient for mass murder . They claim that the \" gas chambers \" were used for delousing clothing and bedding and go into great detail on that subject . They also explain away much of the holocaust evidence as having been faked after the fact , [ for example this fake photo ] ( URL_2 ) , which has been in newspapers , magazines , documentaries , and even hit front - page on Reddit several times . ( I did some research , in this specific case it turns out the photo really was faked and even mainstream historians admit it . ) When asked to explain why so many died in the camps , they often talk about the mass bombing of farms , railways and roads by allied forces nearing the end of the war - meaning that almost no supplies reached the German people , let alone the camps - resulting in many camp inhabitants dying of starvation and disease . WW2 is an incredibly complex topic , made even more difficult to analyze because of the propaganda used by both sides at the time . Again - To understand why people question the holocaust , you have to actually ask those people ( or watch their videos on Youtube ) .

Hemp can be harvested in just a few months, while it can take decades for trees to reach maturity. This means that hemp can be used to produce products more quickly and sustainably than trees. \n2. Hemp is more durable than many types of wood. Hemp fibers are stronger and more flexible than wood fibers, which makes hemp-based products more resistant to cracking, splitting, and breaking. \n3. Hemp requires less land and water to grow. Hemp is a more efficient crop than trees, as it can be grown in a variety of climates and soil types and requires less water and land to produce the same amount of material. \n4. Hemp can be used to make a wider range of products. In addition to being used for paper, textiles, and building materials, hemp can also be used to make biofuels, plastics, and food products. \nOverall, hemp has some advantages over trees as a material for making products, but it's important to note that both have their own unique properties and can be used effectively in different applications."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, young one, hemp is a better choice than trees for making certain products because it grows incredibly fast and doesn't require as many resources as trees do. You see, it takes years for trees to fully grow before they can be used for paper and other products. Hemp, on the other hand, can be grown and harvested in just a few months. Plus, when we make things like paper from trees, it requires large amounts of water, energy, and chemicals to process it into usable products"}
{"question":"Is there always a star or a \" glowing Orb \" in the middle of a planetary system ? If yes , why is it so ? I searched for Hours during my Night Shift and could not find a satisfying answer ... Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Well a quick definition I found for ' planetary system ' required that there be a star , so no . That said there can be rogue planets adrift in space or even theoretically many rogue planets forming their own system of orbits around one another . You can also have systems of orbiting planets where there 's a black hole at the centre rather than a star , thus no ' glowing orb ' .","You need something with considerable mass in order for planets to orbit . It 's possible there are systems orbiting ' dead ' or stillborn stars but we 'll never know because we need light to see them .","Also the only way we can detect exoplanets is by looking at their stars so even if it was possible we would n't know about any ."],"chatgpt_answers":["In most planetary systems, there is a star at the center. This is because planets form from a disk of gas and dust that surrounds the star, and this material eventually clumps together to form planets. The star is the source of heat and light for the planetary system, and it also provides the gravitational force that keeps the planets in orbit around it. \nThere are also some planetary systems that do not have a star at the center. For example, there are planets that orbit around a black hole, or that are not part of any solar system at all (these are known as rogue planets). However, these types of planetary systems are relatively rare, and most planetary systems have a star at the center. \nSo, to answer your question: it is not always the case that there is a glowing orb in the middle of a planetary system, but in most cases, there is a star at the center of the system."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, not all planetary systems have a star or glowing orb in the middle, but most of them do! The reason is that stars are really, really big, and their gravity pulls in lots and lots of gas and dust. This gas and dust is what eventually forms planets, asteroids, and other small objects in the planetary system around the star. So, starlessly planetary systems exist, but they typically don't feature nearly as many objects as those with at least one star."}
{"question":"In the lord of the rings , why do the orcs lose all the time even with numerical advantages ? sorry if this has been asked before Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["So , going way back ( edit : more than 10,000 years prior to the War of the Rings ) , Iluvatar was the original creator of life on the world of Lord of the Rings ( Arda ) , and of his creations , which included the Valar ( beings of great power who basically run things from afar ) and the Maiar ( beings of slightly lesser power , including the istari ( wizards ) like Gandalf and Sauron ) , and the elves , the elves were Iluvatar 's favorites . So , one of the Valar , a bad guy named Morgoth , captured some elves and tried to use them to create his own \" children \" - but they were a perversion of the elves , lesser in every way . These \" children \" are the orcs that continue to live on well after Morgoth 's departure from the world . Sauron and Saruman continue to use them as armies . These orcs live in the darkest places of earth , like Moria , and some of them could n't stand being out in daylight ( though Saruman bred some that could handle it ) . The reason they lose all the time is because ( 1 ) they initially did n't do too well in the sun , ( 2 ) they 're not as smart as elves because they 're a cheap copy , ( 3 ) they do n't have love or any other driving force to help motivate them to really TRY to win , and finally , because it is suggested in Tolkien 's works that when it counts , * when it really counts * , the Valar and Maiar kind of step in and help out a little bit . Gandalf , for example , lends great power and wisdom to the armies of elves and men throughout the War of the Rings , and some of the goodness and power of the valar still run through the earth and water of Arda . It 's some supernatural shit . ( Edit : for example , this is partially why the ringwraiths ( black riders ) are so hesitant to chase after Frodo when Arwen / Glorfindel carries him across the Bruinen , they do n't want to go into the water , because the spirit of the Vala , Ulmo , still resides in some of the waters of Middle Earth ) .

After you get to the company level additional smaller units are usually attached for various purposes the number above are just the direct combat troops . Intelligence , Artillery , Recon , and Logistics can all be attached . The size of those units depends on the size of the parent unit and what is required but its usually 1 or 2 steps lower . So an Infantry Division like the U.S. [ 1st Infantry Division ] ( URL_0 ) during WWI had 2 infantry brigades , an artillery brigade , a regiment of engineers , a battalion each of machine gunners , signal troops , ammunition , supply , engineer , and sanitary trains , and a headquarters company .

Divisions moved in and out of Armies it as needed .

It is comprised of five \" S Shops \" . S-1 is Admin , all the paperwork for promotions , reassignment , demotions , pay , etc . S-2 is Intelligence , which is laminating maps of mission Areas of Operation ( AOs ) , making powerpoints on local cultures , etc .

This is a rather terrible period for most rich ( and even less rich ) countries of europe : globalization killing our industries , oil prices going higher each day ( except right now ) , and lots of other bad things . As well as in the US , the economic situation has grown more and more depressing . The symptoms are showing stronger and stronger ( particularly since 2005/2006 , but there was some shit going on earlier , in the 80s/90s too ) . Hence , there is a strong correlation between the arrival of the euro and the arrival of the troubles in economy , which leads many people to feel like the euro is responsible for it . ( which , in some cases , may be true , too , but the euro has done nothing for a against world - scale social and politics issues ) Moreover , at least in France , the switch from francs ( the french currency before the euro ) and the euro kind of froze the prices in francs in the minds of people . They still remember : before the switch , a baguette cost 3 francs , a journal 3 francs , etc . ( and tend to idealize those prices sometimes ) In the meanwhile , the prices of common goods in euro have risen up due to the normal inflation . And it has been 15 years since then , so a 30 - 40 % rise in prices should be normal due to inflation . And it should be progressive , too , people mostly do n't notice inflation . But this \" freezing \" of the prices in francs in the mind of people makes them realize that the prices have risen , and they do n't get that it 's normal inflation . Then they go on and whine about the higher inflation the euro has caused while it has indeed toned down inflation in comparison to the situation at the time of the francs . Something that may worsen this is the fact that many not - so - common goods have appeared and are growing cheaper and cheaper . Everything electronic does generally not really follow inflation , computers , smartphones , PMPs , do cost lesser and lesser money , so people are more used to the prices going down where this is just an anomaly . Another factor ( quite ironically ) is the feeling of the loss of control over your money . Before , if France wanted , France could just print some more francs and devaluate its currency to fight economical shocks . Even though people know it , they mostly do n't instinctively relate it to a rise of the prices , so they regret we can not just do that and get past the crisis .

While there may be some legitimate debates about a negative influence of the Euro on the Euro - zone economy , I feel that the hate for the euro ( and therefore the Eurozone as it 's its main consequence on everyday life ) is mostly a sheer coincidence : times are hard and people need to blame this on someone , since many do not fully understand the real consequences of the birth of the Euro , they blame everything ( and more ! ) on it .

{"question":"Car engines simplified Hello ELI5 , I 'd like to get a little knowledge about engines . How does a car engine work ? And terms such as cylinders , liters and horsepowers ! Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Maybe this [ gif ] ( URL_1 ) can help you . Oh and this [ one ] ( URL_0 ) as well .","It 's a somewhat overwhelming process but bare with me .. A car engine ( technically known as an internal combustion engine ) goes through a simple four - step process known as the four - stroke cycle . You have the Intake stroke , compression stroke , power stroke , and exhaust stroke . This is a very rapid process that your cars engine goes through to operate . This process involves engine pistons , which draw in and push out air and fuel from the combustion chamber . Also another thing , these pistons move in a set order known as firing order , and varies depending on how many cylinders your car has , and whether the engine is an inline or v - type . You can learn more about firing order here : URL_0 but that 's not the objective here . The pistons in the cylinder are all connected to a crankshaft which sends power to your transmission , which sends that power to the wheels . Aside from pistons , valves also play a crucial role in the four - stroke cycle . These sit inside of the engine head and are virtually ' doors ' for allowing air / fuel in and out of the combustion chamber . Intake stroke : A car engine ' breathes ' in air via the air filter ( in modern engines it 's usually inside of a plastic box to the left / right of your engine , or in a cone filter shape ) , while at the same time fuel is being sent from the fuel tank to fuel injectors ( or carburetor if you have a very old vehicle ) to the combustion chamber . As the piston inside the engine block goes down , the intake valve in the engine head opens up while the exhaust valve remains closed , allowing the air / fuel mixture to access the combustion chamber until the piston can not go down any further . Compression stroke : With both intake and exhaust valves closed , the air / fuel inside of the combustion chamber is compressed ( thus giving it the name Compression stroke ) until the piston is at the top and can not go up and further . Power stroke : This is where the magic happens ! Just as the compressed air is sitting at the top of the piston near the engine head , the air / fuel mixture is ignited via spark plugs ( Diesel engines do not have spark plugs because they can withstand more compression , but they go through nearly the same process as regular gasoline engines do ) and the piston goes back down to its lowest point . Exhaust stroke : Intake valve close , exhaust valve opens , piston goes up and pushes the air / fuel mixture out of ouf the combustion chamber to make room for more air and fuel . * note : This applies mainly to a piston engine , I 'm not very sure how this would work on a rotary engine like in a newer Mazda , but it should be relatively similar . That was n't so bad , was it ? There are gif images around that visually explain how a four - stroke process to prove that what I just explained is n't just crazy - talk . In terms of liters , they just simply determine the displacement for your car 's engine . Simply put , the higher the engine displacement , the more power that engine is willing to put out . This depends on the number of cylinders your car has . A four - cylinder engine can have a displacement from as low as 1.5 to just above 2.0 liters . Six - cylinder engines can have from 2.5 to 3.5 . Rule of thumb , engines usually have half a liter per each cylinder the car has . Horsepower is simply a measurement of how much power an engine puts out . So ya wanna go fast ? To increase horsepower , a proper aftermarket intake and exhaust setup is crucial to promote more air - flow to and from the engine and reduce pressure . Aftermarket camshafts known as simply ' cams ' ( which extend the period in which the valves in the engine head move up ) which also promote more air - flow . Lightweight engine parts such as brakes , suspension , wheels , pulleys , clutch , flywheel ( if you have a manual transmission ) free up some extra rotating and static mass which might not make your car 's horsepower increase , but it will definitely feel a lot faster . A proper turbocharger or supercharger is also one of the best bang - for - your - buck way to increase horsepower , but can be veeeery costly and dangerous if not done 100 % properly . Of course , ecu tuning helps , which optimizes your engines Engine Control Unit to suit other aftermarket parts . A stock car ( such as your grandmother 's 1992 Camry ) has veeery little ( if any ) benefits from only an ecu tune . Woo , that was a doozer ! Well , there goes my two cents on car engines and horsepower . Feel free to ask any questions or prove me wrong on something I was not correct about . I 'm only an 18 - year old kid and I am not a mechanic . Well , not yet lol .","Liters - This and cubic inches are measures of displacement , the amount of room inside the cylinder if all the pistons were at the bottom . All things being equal , more displacement means more fuel and air going into the engine which means more power . Cylinders - These are the holes in the engine block that the pistons move up and down in . Explaining engine configureations is well beyond the scope of ELI5 , but basically fewer pistions = less friction = more power . However , bigger pistons mean more vibration , so several smaller pistons are better than a bunch of big ones . Packaging is also a consideration : a straight 8 is a lot longer than a V8 , so designers moved from straight 8s to V8s once they figured out how to control vibrations in the early 50s . Horsepower - Torque is power , and horsepower is power over time . Think of it this way : a high torque , low hp engine is like a strongman and a low torque , high hp engine is like a sprinter . In a footrace , the sprinter will handily beat the strongman , but if you gave each of them a huge weight to move , the strongman would handily beat the sprinter . That 's why high torque engines are used in trucks and high hp engines are used in sports cars with passenger cars motors falling somewhere in between ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure! A car engine is a machine that converts fuel into energy. It does this by burning a mixture of fuel and air in a small, enclosed space called a cylinder. The energy produced by the burning fuel pushes a metal rod called a piston back and forth inside the cylinder. This movement turns a shaft, which is connected to the car's wheels and makes the car move. \nCylinders are the tubes inside the engine where the fuel is burned and the pistons move. Most car engines have several cylinders, arranged in a line or in a \"V\" shape. The more cylinders an engine has, the more fuel it can burn at once and the more powerful it is. \nThe size of an engine is usually measured in liters. This refers to the volume of the cylinders, or how much space there is inside them for the fuel to burn. A larger engine will have bigger cylinders and will be able to burn more fuel, which can make the car go faster. \nHorsepower is a unit of measurement for the power of an engine. It tells you how much work the engine can do in a certain amount of time.

{"question":"Why did they make so many versions of \" the \" in German , like der , dem , das , die , whereas there 's only one in English ? I know they 're for differently gendered words and plurals , but why is it necessary ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["\" They \" did n't make German that way ; languages evolve naturally . You can count on the fingers of at most two hands the languages that were deliberately invented : Esperanto , Volapük , Klingon and so on . Actually , English used to have several different words for \" the \" , just like modern German still does . Here they are : | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Plural --|--|--|--|-- * * Nominative * * | se | þǣt | sēo | þā * * Accusative * * | þone | þǣt | þā | þā * * Genitive * * | þæs | þæs | þǣre | þāra * * Dative * * | þǣm | þǣm | þǣre | þāra * * Instrumental * * | þȳ | þȳ | þāre | þǣm ( The letter \" þ \" is how \" th \" used to be written . ) Over time , as English evolved , the case and gender system became simplified , until eventually it disappeared altogether , leaving us only with one word , \" the \" . German also evolved , but not quite as much , so modern German still has a case and gender system : but it has already dropped the instrumental case , the accusative case differs from the nominative case only in the masculine singular , and the genitive case is being used less than it used to be . The Dutch language has also evolved , further than German but not quite as far as English : the case system has virtually disappeared , and the Dutch for \" the \" is \" de \" except for the neuter singular , which is \" het \" . Why are genders and cases necessary ? Well , in one sense , they 're not ; but they are n't there because somebody thought they were necessary . They 're there because the language evolved that way . Cases , of course , are useful so that you know what the relationship between different parts of the sentence is . If , if German , you say \" Den Mann beißt der Hund \" , the \" den \" makes it clear that it is the dog that bites the man , not the other way around . In English ( and increasingly in German ) , we use word order instead of case : \" The man bites the dog \" means something quite different from \" The dog bites the man \" . Nobody knows for certain why noun genders exist , but the best guess is that humans just like to categorize things . In that sense , calling them \" genders \" is unhelpful ; although people an animals may be put into different categories based on their biological sex , that 's obviously not so with inanimate nouns like \" der Tisch \" , \" die Lampe \" or \" das Haus \" . Just call them \" categories \" . Why nouns should be categorized in this way is n't known , but different cultures have different ways of categorizing things : one culture , for example , might have one category for men and gods , and a different category for women and inanimate objects ; others have a large number of categories according to shape and size , so one category might be \" long and thin \" , another might be \" round and flat \" , and so on . European languages just call these categories \" masculine \" , \" feminine \" and sometimes \" neuter \" , but those really are just names for the categories . That 's about all we know for sure .","It 's the nature of the language , just like you have masculine and feminine nouns in Spanish and French . English is one of the few languages not to have differently gendered words .","The French has Le , La , and Les . The Spanish have similar versions . In \" romance languages \" nouns have \" genders \" ( feminine and masculine ) and thus there are different versions of \" the \" to indicate the gender of the noun . And a different version for plurals as well . Why does this exist ? Why does grammar exist ? I have a theory and it 's called Error Correction . In computer code , you sent error detection or correction bits at the end of each byte of data . This could be something as simple as a checksum bit ( adding up the bits in the byte and indicating even or odd ) or could be something as complex as a hamming code , which can actually correct bad data . The idea is , if the ECC shows an error , you can ask for re - transmission of the data . So , for example , if I say \" La Chat \" in French , it grates on your nerves , as \" Chat \" ( cat ) is a masculine noun , and \" La \" indicated feminine . You might ask the speaker , \" Did you mean ' Le Chat ' or ' La Chien ' ? \" to clarify , as clearly there was an error in the preceding sentence . We have similar ECC 's in the English language . For example , the verb \" to be \" is conjugated differently depending on whether the subject is singular , plural , past , or future tense . We do n't have genders in our nouns , of course . So , while rappers may say \" I be , he be , she be , they be \" in a sort of Esperanto version of English , the correct declination is \" I am , he is , they are , they will be , they were \" etc . If I was to say \" He are ... \" you would immediately realize there is an error in the sentence . Either I meant to say \" They are \" or \" He is \" and you might ask for clarification . It really is no different than a checksum bit . Maybe the future of language will eliminate grammar and we will go to the \" I be , he be , she be , they be \" kind of simplified English . And maybe this is a reflection of better communications channels today . But grammar did n't just happen , nor it is some arbitrary set of rules . It has a function in language to act as an error correction code , just as your computer uses ECC to detect bad data . FWIW . P.S. - there is another evolutionary aspect of grammar in language and that is to help people detect those who are of their group and those not of it . You might call this a language version of IFF ( Identify Friend or Foe ) which is an electronic system used in warfare today to tell the good guys from the bad guys . In language , grammar and accent serve the same purpose . In times long past , primitive peoples had to be able to identify , quickly , who was one of their tribe , and who of another . It was a survival skill . How they spoke their language and how well , was often an determinant . And this was true even in modern times . In WW II , it was awfully hard for American spies to \" pass \" as Germans , as the language , grammar , and accent are hard to fake . A lot of stuff we think of as \" just happening because of chance \" turns out to have some sort of purpose or survival skill . IMHO ."],"chatgpt_answers":["In German, as in many other languages, the articles (the words for \"the\" in English) change depending on the noun they are referring to.

The articles \"dem\" and \"den\" are used for the dative case (a grammatical case used to indicate the recipient of an action), and \"des\" is used for the genitive case (a grammatical case used to indicate possession or origin). \nIn English, we do not have to worry about these different forms of the article because English does not have grammatical cases or gender for nouns.

{"question":"Why CPU 's are approaching 4.5 gigahertz but GPU 's around 1 gigahertz are still fairly common For example : My FX-8320 is has a base clock of 3.5 gigahertz but my Radeon HD 7950 , which i spent more money on , is only 800 megahertz Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["GPUs and CPUs are very different beasts . And while we 're at it , clock speed is not a very good indicator of the actual performance of a CPU . There are lots of factors . the clock speed tells us the rate at which electrons travel through the circuit and settle down . It 's called a machine cycle . CPUs have an instruction set , that is a set of basic operations that they can perform . Each operation takes a certain number of machine cycles to complete . These operations are things like \" add , \" \" multiply , \" \" logical and , \" or \" memory read . \" There 's also something called pipelining , which allows multiple instructions to take place at the same time , but then you have to be careful about dependence on other instructions ! ( if instruction A adds two numbers and instruction B adds the result to a 3rd number , B has to wait for A ! but if A adds two numbers and B adds two different numbers , they may be able to run simultaneously . Good pipelining / optimization can detect this ) So pipelining and optimization is important . Many instructions , particularly memory reads , which are extremely important , and a good portion of what a program is doing at any given time , take several machine cycles to execute . And memory reads are really common . So the speed of communication between CPU and memory is really important , because if memory reads take fewer machine cycles , whole programs will run faster . There 's also special memory that exists on the CPU chip , called registers . The size and number of registers are also extremely important . But even above all that , the program that 's running and the way that it 's optimized for the CPU will probably have the most impact of all on performance . Also important , and increasingly so , is parallelization , which is where we tie in GPUs . A CPU runs one instruction after another ( with some pipelining , but it 's limited how much you can do at once with pipelining , you still need instructions to happen in order ) . Nowadays there are multiple cores , that means that there are two or more CPUs that can be executing their own instructions in sequence . You can do two or more things at once . This requires a more complex branch of programming called \" parallel programming \" to take full advantage of . ( CPUs can also have threads , which basically means that one CPU runs two lists of instructions by rapidly interleaving them ) . GPUs are the ultimate parallel processors . Unlike a CPU , a GPU does n't rely on rapidly executing a list of instructions in order , instead it executes a LOT of instructions simultaneously . Potentially thousands at once . This means that the things they are suited for are different . While a CPU is good for sequential ( serial ) operations where later instructions are dependent on the results of earlier instructions , GPUs are suited for problems where there is n't a lot of dependence . Like graphics . If you want to rapidly update every pixel on screen within 1/60th of a second , or do a bunch of matrix computations for 3D gaming ( did you see the top post on /r / askscience about linear algebra today ? ) , you do n't want a CPU to do millions of sequential operations . You want a GPU to do a couple massively parallel operations . That 's a high level description of the difference","A CPU is like a guy running a parkour race , he can go as fast as he wants , he can make decisions , take shortcuts , but there is only one of him . So in an hour , he could have moved one person 5 miles . Even if you have multiple CPUs , they can each take their own route . A GPU is like a marching band in a parade . They all have to move in the same direction at the same time , only as fast as the slowest member , and coordinating to keep together . the route has to be planned out , and closed to other traffic , However if there were 100 band members , even if they only go 1 mile in an hour , they have moved 20 times as much as the single runner .","CPUs and GPUs work a little differently .

Not sure I understand Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["So essentially the Swiss national bank ( snb)decided to remove a currency cap which was set in place in 2011 to fight against the strong increasing value of the currency against the euro . Back then it almost hit a point of parity ( close to even value for currency ) and the Swiss export industries ( mainly tourism ) were greatly suffering . Now the cap which was set at 1.20 to the euro has been removed and the currency appreciated to it 's natural value which as of right now is exactly in parity to the euro . The situation is crazy , the currency appreciated by a ridiculous amount in almost 15 minutes . The snb did this in order to fight the quantitative easing the European Central Bank is going to be implementing soon to help the struggling euro zone nations such as Italy , Portugal , Ireland , Spain , Greece which all combined have a many trillions in state debt and are all fighting huge levels of unemployment . So to sum up the currency cap was removed , the currency sky rocketed to it 's natural value and the Swiss export industries are suffering greatly . Source - my roommate who is a very active forex trader Hope I did n't fuck up as I 'm on mobile","While of course it 's more complicated than this . Essentially , the Swiss economy has been doing a lot better than the Eurozone economy , which meant the Swiss franc was rising relative to the euro over time . This is bad , in some ways , for Switzerland because it means Eurozone nations must pay more to import Swiss products . Swiss companies want a \" weaker \" franc , so the rest of Europe will buy their products from them rather than someplace cheaper . So , the Swiss National Bank decided to enforce an artificial cap on the exchange rate at 1.2 francs per euro . With this cap in place , 1.2 to 1 was the lowest it could get , but it could always go higher . Thus , traders and investors bet on the euro to rise against the franc , feeling safe due to the cap . In addition , since currency usually only moves a % in the short term , investors can borrow a lot more money to trade . However , the Swiss National Bank abruptly removed that cap , which caused the franc to immediately rise 30 % and since the change was so rapid , most could not sell their investments fast enough . Now those who borrowed money are in a lot of debt or insolvent , which included the largest foreign - exchange broker in the US and Asia , FXCM , Inc.","Both the Swiss decoupling and the US stock decline are likely a response to the upcoming ECB QE , which is probably going to be of a truly massive scale . My best guess is Draghi let the Swiss and a few favored private banks ( like Draghi 's BFFs at Goldman ) know that not only was QE coming , but that it will be larger than expected . The SNB was forced to surrender the peg , as holding it would have exposed the balance sheet to insolvency . They also had to do it secretly and suddenly ( since any announcement of a future plan to abandon a peg exposes a central bank to massive losses ) . The kicker is the SNB may still try to knock down the franc by buying non - Euro currencies ( primarily the USD ) . It will also likely try to reduce its accumulated stock of toxic Euros by selling at strategic times , which will encourage macro funds to bet against the Euro .

{"question":"What was Prussia ? I still do n't understand what Prussia actually was . It was a collection of separate states , but why was the name so close to \" Russia \" and when / how did it become Germany ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Prussia was a Germanic Kingdom in north - central Europe from 1701 to 1918 . It played a key role in the unification of Germany in the 19th century . There 's no real link between the words \" Prussia \" and \" Russia \" ; they just happen to sound very similar in English . In 1815 , in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars , 35 ( later 40 ) Germanic Kingdoms , Duchies , Principalities and Free Cities were organized into the German Confederation . This was a loose affiliation if independent states , primarily designed to keep a check on the ambitions of its two largest and most powerful members : the Kingdom of Prussia and the Empire of Austria . The 19th century was the time of the birth of nationalism , and the development of national identity . German nationalism was a powerful force among German speakers , and new liberal and nationalist movements wanted a united state for all German speaking people . This culminated in a failed revolution in 1848 , intended to create such a state . Even among traditionalist , conservative upper classes , who preferred maintaining a loose Confederate structure , the questions of nationalism and unification had to be addressed . There were two competing answers to the question : \" Greater Germany \" and \" Lesser Germany \" . \" Greater Germany \" was the plan to have a single state controlling all German territories , ruled by Austria . \" Lesser Germany \" was the desire to have a Confederation of German states dominated by Prussia and excluding Austria . In 1862 , Prussia 's King Wilhelm I appointed Otto von Bismarck as his Chancellor . Bismarck , the \" Iron Chancellor \" , wanted to promote the \" Lesser Germany \" solution and move Prussia into a dominant position as soon as possible . In 1866 , disputes over the administration of the newly captured Schleswig and Holstein territories led to war between Austria and Prussia . Prussia won the war resoundingly , and the German Confederation was dissolved . Prussia annexed a great deal of territory in north - central Europe , and incorporated remaining small states into the North German Confederation . This was essentially a means by which Prussia could dominate the other northern Kings , Dukes and Princes . Austria was excluded , as where the southern states of Wuttemburg , Bavaria and Baden . By 1870 , Bismarck had maneuvered Prussia into the position of being the only Germanic state with the military power to protect all other Germanic states . He had created a network of defensive alliances between the states mandating that , if one was attacked , they all must come to its aid . In 1870 , a Prince of the Hohenzollern family ( the family that ruled Prussia ) was offered the throne of Spain . This did not go down well in France , where Napoleon III was none too keen on having powerful Hohenzollern 's on both sides of his country . Expecting Austria to support him ( wrongly ) , Napoleon III 's France declared war on Prussia . Now , thanks to Bismarck 's network of defensive alliances , every Germanic state was ( somewhat reluctantly ) at war with France and under the de facto leadership of the Prussian military . The inferior French army was crushed , Napoleon was captured and by 1871 Paris was under siege . The French government crumbled . In the heat of victory , the Germanic princes and military leaders proclaimed Wilhelm * Kaiser * of the new German Empire at the Palace of Versailles in 1871 . Every Germanic state except Austria was incorporated into the new Empire . The German Empire consisted of 4 Kingdoms ( Prussia , Bavaria , Saxony and Wuttemburg ) , 5 Duchies , 6 Grand Duchies , 7 Principalities , 3 Free Cities and the territory of Alsace - Lorraine . Each territory had its own royal ruler , over whom the Emperor ( Wilhelm I , then Wilhelm II , who were Kings of Prussia ) ruled . The Prussian aristocracy - called Junkers - were the most powerful political and military class . This was situation that would remain until the collapse of the Empire in 1918 , after defeat in the First World War .","Prussia was it 's own state and associated with the Holy Roman Empire for a long time . The HRE was a collection of Germanic states that got traded among many dukes , kings , emperors , et cetera for a long time .

If you want more information about the when and how of Prussia becoming part of Germany ( or the creation of Germany in general ) check out Otto von Bismarck . He was Prussian and is credited with uniting Germany as it is today ( kinda ) .

They retain their ability to deform around imperfections in the road , which keeps as much tire - to - road contact as possible . Studded tires are normally made of the softer rubber , but include metal studs . On a sheet of ice , studded tires can be great . The weight of the car forces the studs to break into the ice , not unlike a cat 's claws . On dry and wet roads , the studs prevent the rubber around them from contacting the road , significantly reducing traction . Braking distance increases quite a bit . They also cause lots of damage to the roads over the years . My advice is to use studless winter traction tires , keep a light foot and plenty of space between you and the car ahead . Driving in snow and ice is dangerous and too many people believe that studs or 4x4 means they can drive like its a sunny day . In the end , the driver will affect safety far more than any tires .

However, studded tires can be noisy and may cause damage to the road surface, so they are not legal in all areas. \nWinter tires, also known as \"snow tires,\" are made from a special rubber compound that remains flexible in cold temperatures.

In others it is recommended that : live vertebrates are not used as a food unless they are required absolutely as a food source by a species or individual animal ; live rodents should not be left in a reptile enclosure overnight or for an extended period ; and wild - caught rodents should not be used .

{"question":"Why did the Nazis use heavy water ( deuterium oxide ) in an attempt to invent atomic weapons ? In the process , what is heavy water used for ? Why is it necessary , and why were they so interested in it ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["It makes it easier to sustain a chain reaction using normal fuel . Its a neutron moderator , you can use it in heavy water based reactors ( that do not require enriched uranium ) such as the Canadian CANDU . Heavy water moderated reactors running on unenriched uranium could eventually produce enough plutonium for a bomb . You could have used Graphite instead , i think .","First , they were trying to build a nuclear reactor , not a nuclear bomb . Even those who think they were trying to build a bomb acknowledge this — it is because building large reactors is one of the paths to creating the fuel for a bomb . In a nuclear reactor , you are trying to get uranium-235 atoms to absorb neutrons so that they split , releasing more neutrons . The fuel for a reactor , however , has very little U-235 in it . Unenriched fuel , which is what everyone during WWII was using , has less than 1 % U-235 in it . The rest of the fuel is U-238 , which will not fission easily . So the odds of an individual neutron hitting a U-235 atom are low , and the odds that the neutrons produced by the subsequent fission reaction will find another U-235 atom are also low . This is why you can put as much unenriched uranium in one place as you want and normally nothing will happen . To increase the odds , there are two things you can do . One is to increase the relative quantity of U-235 in the fuel — enrichment . This is how a bomb works , and many reactors today also work this way ( standard civilian power reactor fuel is enriched to 3 - 4 % U-235 , a nuclear bomb is 80 - 90 % U-235 ) . The other is to add what is known as a \" moderator . \" A moderator is a light element that the neutrons created by fission reactions can bounce off of . This bouncing decreases their energy / speed / temperature ( all the same thing at this scale ) . Low - energy neutrons have a higher likelihood of getting absorbed by U-235 atoms than higher - energy neutrons . The reason has to do with the fact that at those sizes , the relationship between the speed of a particle and the size of a particle are inverse ; from the neutron 's perspective , the U-235 atoms get bigger when it slows down . More or less . So if you take unenriched uranium and intersperse it with a good moderator , the atoms from fission will get slowed down , and that increases the chance they 'll find and hit another U-235 atom , and the reaction will continue . The two candidates for moderators that were explored during World War II were graphite ( basically just carbon atoms ) and heavy water . ( Regular water can worked with slightly enriched uranium , but not unenriched uranium ; there are obscure nuclear physics reasons for this . ) In the US , they used graphite . At first they found that graphite did n't work that well . They discovered that this was n't a problem with graphite , per se , but because the methods of producing graphite introduced impurities like boron , which is a neutron absorber . So they worked with the graphite producers to make extremely pure graphite , which worked very well . The US also built several heavy water plants , in case the graphite did n't work out . They did produce a heavy water reactor ( CP-3 ) that went online in 1944 , but their main reactors used graphite . In Germany , they explored graphite but also found it did n't work well . They did n't realize this was because of impurities . So they pursued only the heavy water route , because they had heavy water production facilities under their control . However , they never acquired enough heavy water to actually make a nuclear reactor ( and this is unrelated to the sabotage of the heavy water plant by the Allies , as an aside ) , and even if they had acquired enough , it would have , at most , allowed them to make a small , experimental nuclear reactor , not generate enough plutonium to make a nuclear bomb . The notion that the Germans were close to getting a bomb is a complete myth — they were very far from it by the end of the war . So , to conclude : heavy water was chosen as a moderator for the German reactor experiments . [ Here is a graphic ] ( URL_0 ) which compares US and German heavy water stockpiles , and even if is a little misleading because a lot of the German heavy water was diluted . CP-3 is shown to give you an idea of how much heavy water you need for a small nuclear reactor .

The opposite gendered wolves and dogs are simply put off by the hybrid , hence wo n't have sex with it , and that 's enough to make them dogs and wolves not the same species .

It is also very unlikely that a baby born from a horse and a human could reproduce itself, because its DNA would be so different from either of its parents. \nSo, to sum it up, the main reason that two different species can't have offspring together is because their DNA is incompatible and would not allow for a healthy, viable offspring."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, it all comes down to DNA.

The butterfly effect is an illustration of chaos : for some things , even a small difference in initial conditions will change the outcome drastically . For example it is thought that the worldwide weather is not a random process , it 's a completely predictable phenomenon ... assuming we could know the initial conditions with extreme precision . If you could reproduce the exact same initial conditions , you would get the exact same result each time . But if you change the initial conditions even a little bit , like a butterfly flapping its wings in Japan , it can change the outcome and give you a tornado in Brazil months later . But unlike the snowballing effect , the butterfly did not initiate the tornado . It 's all the initial conditions that resulted in the tornado . In summary : Snowballing effect : small cause -- > big result Butterfly effect : small difference in the initial conditions -- > big difference in the result","The idea is that they way something is right now is a result of millions of things that happened before .

Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi or Kanji in Japanese) are the primary written form of Chinese and have a long history dating back over 3,000 years. They are still used today because they are an important part of Chinese culture and history, and they are also very efficient for written communication. \nOne of the main reasons that Pinyin is not used as the primary written form of Chinese is that it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words. Chinese characters, on the other hand, can convey the full meaning and pronunciation of a word in a single character. For example, the Chinese character for \"water\" is 水, which is pronounced \"shui\" in Mandarin. Pinyin cannot represent the meaning of the character, only the pronunciation. \nAdditionally, replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin as the primary written form of Chinese would be a massive undertaking that would involve changing the way that Chinese is taught in schools, updating dictionaries and other reference materials, and potentially requiring people to learn a new writing system. It would also be difficult to determine a standard way to represent the many different regional accents and dialects of Chinese using the Roman alphabet. \nIn summary, while Pinyin is a useful tool for learning Chinese and transcribing proper nouns, it is not used as the primary written form of Chinese because it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words, and replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin would be a major undertaking."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well friend, China has a rich history and culture which includes the use of symbolic writing, also known as Chinese characters.

In reality , people take free stuff and stop spending money because they come to expect it all for free .","TV stations get money from advertisers . During a regular TV show the viewer most likely sits on the couch and endures the ads - several commercials at a time . In streaming the viewer is typically at a computer watching the show . In that case the viewer can navigate away from a commercial pretty easily and come back to the show after it begins again . They can even rewind the show so if they leave while the commercial is playing and come back after the show 's been running for a few minutes they can still rewind it easily enough . To thwart the viewer from leaving , the TV - streaming service will shorten the ad breaks to just 1 or two commercials . This makes it less troublesome to a viewer to sit and watch than a normal 5 minute break on regular TV . But , the shorter commercial break means fewer ads from a less interested viewer base . Therefore , less money from the advertisers . Services like Hulu and Netflix pay a flat fee to run shows in syndication . Other than the licensing fee the TV stations do n't make money . In summary , TV stations get better ad revenue from their over - the - air broadcast than they do from their streaming service ( like their website ) . They get significantly more money from broadcast than they do from Netflix or online - streaming . If you look at Netflix 's lineup you see they have a lot of showtime and HBO shows . That 's because those channels ca n't run their shows in syndication on normal TV ( cussing , sex , violence , etc ) . They also do n't generate ad revenue . HBO and Showtime also know that most shows wo n't do well selling box sets of the seasons ( most people do n't really care to buy TV series in seasons ) . So the best option for them is to put the TV series on Netflix and get the licensing fees . TL;DR : TV stations make money off ads and a listening viewer base .

{"question":"Why do we write Wednesday when we say \" Wendsday \" ? Or am i the only one ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Because \" Wednesday \" is how the word is actually spelled and should be pronounced , however most people do n't pronounce it properly because \" wednes - day \" does n't flow well so it 's common to drop the first D. Since Wednesday is derived from Odin ( Woden 's Day ) the N was already the stressed / more prominent sound . Since English lacks a stop and this DN is such a difficult letter pairing , the N simply won out over time . You 're probably not the only one , but it 's usually closer to \" Wenz - day \" than \" Wends - day \" or \" Wednes - day \" , or at least that 's the case in California .","I had a teacher who actually encouraged us to pronounce it \" wed - ned - day \" ... I realized later that was just so we could remember how to spell it . At least I hope that was the reason .","Languages change and evolve over time , quite naturally . Basically , speaking involves moving the tongue , lips , jaw , lungs and vocal cords in very , very precise ways , which is actually very difficult to do . In particular , the tongue has to do a lot of precision work and is constantly being dragged around the inside of your mouth , moving forward and back , up and down , sometimes being curled up and then thrust forward again . This is how tongue - twisters work : they usually contain a series of very similar \" phonemes \" ( as individual sounds are called ) that have to be pronounced in very quick succession . For example , \" She sells sea - shells ... \" works because for \" sh \" the tongue has to bunch up near the back of the mouth so the middle of the tongue touches the roof near the back , but for \" s \" the tip of the toungue has to touch the alveolar ridge , just behind the top row of teeth . The tongue twister relies on the fact that the tongue has to be manipulated from one extreme to the other and there is , quite simply , a limit to how fast the tongue can physically move . Over time , then -- that is , over periods measured in generations -- pronunciations tend to become simplified in various different ways . One way this happens is for entire syllables to become weaker and weaker , until eventually they are glossed over entirely . \" Wednesday \" was originally \" Wōdnesdæg \" , pronounced \" WODE - nez - dye \" ; by Shakespeare 's time the \" o \" had changed to an \" e \" giving \" Wednesdei \" or \" Wednesday \" , but still pronounced with three syllables . In Shakespeare 's day , people spelled words in whatever way they saw fit , but a little later the spellings became fixed . However , the pronunciations continued to change , and this is one reason modern English words are often not pronounced the way they are written . \" Wed - nes - day \" is simply a bit of a mouthful . The biggest problem is \" d \" followed by \" n \" ; both sounds are pronounced with the tip of the tongue on the alveolar ridge . But to pronounce the \" d \" properly , you have to take the tongue off the alvoelar ridge , but then put it right back on the alveolar ridge again for the \" n \" . Then you have to take the tongue off the alveolar ridge again for the \" e \" and then put it straight back on again for the \" s \" . This means that your tongue is constantly flapping around behind your teeth , and it 's a bit much . So , the first \" d \" starts being pronounced without being released : speakers would keep the tongue where it was and just briefly stop the flow of air ; and then it just kind of merges into the \" n \" completely . Meanwhile the \" e \" in \" nes \" becomes weaker and then also disappears . So what you 're left with is people saying \" -dnesd- \" without moving the tongue , and that just sounds like \" -nsd- \" . An entire syllable has just vanished . But the spelling \" Wednesday \" was already fixed , and because the English language has n't had a proper spelling reform for centuries , we still spell it the old way . The process is still continuing . You never hear anyone say \" What is up ? \" -- it 's always \" collapsed \" into \" What 's up ? \" or further into \" Wassup ? \" with some speakers reducing it to one syllable , \" Sup ? \" Some may regard this as \" illiterate \" or \" uneducated \" , but it is exactly the same process that changed \" All Hallows ' Even \" into \" Halloween \" and \" God be with ye \" into \" Bye \" . It 's impossible to say whether \" Sup ? \" is just a passing fad , but it may be that our great - grandchildren will use \" Sup \" the same way we use \" Hi \" and think it perfectly normal ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The way we spell words and the way we say them out loud can sometimes be different.

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["It 's likely that you 've gotten used to the feeling of air bubbles within but it feels better if they are n't present ( ie . They would cause discomfort if you were n't already desensitized ) . That 's why it feels better when you pop them ( \" cracking \" your neck ) .","Due to a lack of real expertise in the comments on this question , I 'll chime in . This has NOTHING to do with the noise , everything to do with the stability of your neck . When you want to \" crack \" you neck , you are actually feeling a sense of limitation of motion in a part of your neck . When you \" crack \" it , you are actually forcing some part of the neck to over - compensate and become hyper - flexible . This hyper - flexibility stretches some of the joints between vertebrae ( and there are several that it could be ) , and this stretching causes bubble to form , they were n't always present as some redditors suggest . The bubble formation is in line with physic 's gas laws ( notably P1V1 = P2V2 ) that say when the volume of a joint space increase , the pressure inside the joint decreases . Decreased pressure ( especially in a rapid format ) causes gases that are otherwise dissolved in your fluids ( N2 , O2 , CO2 ) to form little bubbles , much like opening a soda forms bubbles . The formation of a bubble makes a noise , and that noise is a popping sound . It is also amplified greatly in your neck because this happens so close to your ears . These bubbles eventually dissolve back into the fluids of your body , which is why you ca n't crack your knuckles several times in a row . If you can crack a joint several times in a row , it is likely not a bubble formation ( called a cavitation ) . To the long term effects ... \" cracking \" your spine alone will not cause an issue . However , both the immobility of some segments that cause the feeling of needing to crack and the hypermobility of the habit of cracking do create structural instabilities in how your spine supports your body , moves and even the function of the nerves that radiate from the spine . \" Cracking \" does NOT FIX ANY PROBLEMS , as some people may suggest . We know this because the sensation of needing to crack does not go away . These long - term instability do create problems , including arthritis , nerve irritation , ligament instabilities and many secondary symptoms as a result of these conditions ( muscle spasms , headaches , abnormal sensations like burning , the list goes on ... ) To address a relevant misconception , a chiropractor ( specifically , a type of chiropractor who performs what is called Structural Chiropractic ) uses analytical methods to identify the regions of the spine responsible for the sensation of needing to crack the spine and corrects those specific regions . With some repeat adjustments and a good doctor , these regions can stabilize , causing the feeling to resolve completely . This comment opens so many doors , but here 's the TL;DR Cracking your neck is forcing a temporary hyper - mobility of the spine to compensate for instability in the spine in some other region . Cracking it does not correct the instability , hence the return of the sensation . Source : I 'm a Structural Chiropractor .","The explanations of cracking given on this thread are wrong , its is cavitation bubbles . As you manipulate your joints you cause pressure changes in the fluids around your joints . The drop in pressure at certain areas causes voids to form , there are some gases in these bubbles , but compared to the pressure in the surrounding liquids , there may as well not be any , and can be treated as vacuums for the moment . These bubbles then pop as the fluid rushes back in . The small amount of gas inside then becomes over pressurized from the inward momentum of the fluid , and the now tiny bubble 's gasses get forced out violently resulting in a small sonic boom , the crack , and also interestingly sometimes light from the extreme temperatures the pressure brings ( up to several thousand kelvin in certain cavitations ) I do n't know if this applies in our joints though . Also as a note there have been no studies supporting that it causes damage , there was a man who won a joke Nobel , an Ig Nobel Prize , for cracking one hand 's knuckles for 60 years but not the other .

It 's not a zero sum game , but wealth introduction starts somewhere and the way classes handle it when they get it are different and it lends itself to the argument of inequality being a net bad when left unchecked . The following are all generalizations : Rich people save money , much much more than the average person . Yes , they live comparably extravagant lives , but what they are spending is often a smaller percentage of their income than what a middle class person spends . Middle class , I just lump them all in here , are people that save a little but overall spend most of their salary . They buy houses , luxury items , they really spend and it 's healthy for the economy when they do this . Poor people , they do n't make a lot of money and spend it all , but entirely on necessities and not a lot of discretionary spending . Income inequality tends to remove buying power from the middle classes , turning them lower , and gives that money to the rich who will tend to save it . Saving is actually a bad thing for the economy when done in excess , this is contrary to what we are taught as individuals . The economy is based on spending , that s what the downturn we experienced can be generalised as , a lack of spending , self reinforced . The rich are n't completely useless , they are sometimes savvy investors , business owners and people who make some important parts of the economy happen , without their capital there would be nothing .

Both transmit the information in the form of electromagnetic waves . AM works by modulating ( varying ) the amplitude of the signal or carrier transmitted according to the information being sent , while the frequency remains constant . This differs from FM technology in which information ( sound ) is encoded by varying the frequency of the wave and the amplitude is kept constant . URL_0","FM and AM stand for \" frequency modulated \" and \" amplitude modulated \" . Imagine if you were in a room full of people who are all talking at the same time . Your friend asks you a question but you ca n't hear him because everyone else is talking . Now imagine that you 're in that same room but this time your friend has a very high and squeaky voice . This makes it very easy to pick them out in a room full of bassy talkers . This is what AM and FM are doing ( each in their own way ) .

As I 'm sure you learned in your science class , radio waves are , well ... waves ! If you graph them , they 're lines that go up , then down , up , then down . Each wave has slightly different characteristics . The frequency is how \" scrunched together \" the ups and downs are . Lines that go up and down very quickly over a short period are \" high frequency . \" Another characteristic is the amplitude - how high and low those ups and downs are . Lines that go waay up high and then waaay down low have a \" high amplitude \" The wave that 's being emitted from the tower is made to produce waves that are ONLY in that pattern ( this is called \" modulation \" ) . When your radio is receiving signals from the radio tower , it 's listening for a specific pattern based on either amplitude or frequency .

{"question":"What does US shale have to do with falling gas prices ? I have read there 's some sort of correlation , but I do n't understand it . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["From what I 've heard , shale is only profitable to mine for oil when oil is more than about $ 60 per barrel . Trying to lobby for permits to extract the oil from the shale takes a long time . If OPEC can continue to push oil prices down below that $ 60 mark , then everyone important loses interest in shale , starting the lobbying process over , while OPEC can raise prices again .","Boiled down very far , it is cheaper for a country like Saudi Arabia to produce a barrel of oil than it is for the entire rest of the world ( US Shale included ) . If Saudi Arabia floods the market with oil , the price will drop because so much is available . If the price drops enough , companies will lose money by producing oil , so they will be forced to stop and that leaves the profits to the countries that can still earn money by producing . When enough competition has to quit , they can start shrinking their output which will increase the price . They will be able to control the price of oil and keep it in a region where it maximizes their profits while still keeping others out of market because it is n't worth it for them . For example , Saudi Arabia can create a barrel for say $ 5 where it costs an average US shale company $ 45 dollars . If a barrel sells for $ 100 on the open market , both will make money . If a barrel sells for $ 40 , then only Saudi Arabia makes money . No company will stay in business long if it loses money every time it sells something - either it 'll go broke or shift focus elsewhere . So at $ 100 , both Saudi and US shale sell oil . At $ 40 only Saudi is selling oil . Countries can leverage this against each other because unlike the US , many countries are extremely reliant on oil revenue . As such it is an instrument of power available to those with vast , cheap oil reserves . That 's overly simplified , but is the general concept .","energy independence . We 're projected to outproduce the Saudis in energy exports . Also , we 're one of the ( geographically ) largest nations in the world , so we 're depending on our energy also . ON A SIDE NOTE Unlike the Saudis , Russians and UAE , the US does not * * own * * our energy companies . So , without cogent corporate tax reform ( particularly in the energy sector ) lower energy prices does not necessarily translate into lower cost of goods . Example : Dairy company also owns distribution ( transportation ) . Lower cost of energy means lower transport costs , which equate into higher revenue . E.g. price of milk , 12 oz steak nor toilet paper has n't dropped locally because companies can exploit lower energy while not benefitting the consumer ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Shale is a type of sedimentary rock that contains a high amount of oil and natural gas. In the United States, there are large deposits of shale in places like Texas and North Dakota. In the past decade, new technologies have been developed that make it possible to extract oil and natural gas from shale deposits in a process called hydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking.\" \nWhen the demand for oil and natural gas is high, companies will extract and sell as much as they can, which can drive up the price of these fuels. On the other hand, when there is a lot of shale oil and natural gas being produced, it can increase the overall supply of these fuels and lead to lower prices. This is because there is more of the fuel available, so there is less competition among buyers, which can drive down the price. \nSo, in short, the production of shale oil and natural gas can affect the price of these fuels by increasing the overall supply and decreasing the demand for them.

For example, a company might be allowed to consider a person's sex if it is a \"bona fide occupational qualification,\" or BFOQ, which means that it is necessary for the job. \nIn the case of Hooters, the company has argued that its female employees are part of its \"brand identity\" and that hiring only women who meet certain physical characteristics is a BFOQ. However, this argument has not always been successful in court. In some cases, Hooters has been sued by women who claimed that they were not hired because they did not meet the company's physical standards. In other cases, the company has faced criticism for its policies, but no legal action has been taken. \nOverall, it is important to remember that every company has a responsibility to treat all job candidates fairly and not discriminate against them based on their sex, race, religion, or any other protected characteristic."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, you see, adult restaurants like Hooters have different laws that let them have a certain \"look\" when hiring employees.

When our eyes are open, we are processing a lot of visual information, which can be distracting. By closing our eyes, we can tune out distractions and focus on the physical sensations of the kiss, such as the warmth and softness of our partner's lips, the taste of their mouth, and the feeling of their breath on our skin. \nAnother reason is that closing our eyes can help us feel more connected to our partner. When we look at someone, we are using our eyes to see and understand what is going on around us. But when we close our eyes, we are trusting our partner and letting go of our need to see and control what is happening.

{"question":"Why can you feel the air blowing out of a hoover from about a meter away , but the suction on the end of the pipe can only be felt a couple of inches away ? Its the same quantity of air moving , so why the difference ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The suction is n't directional in the same way . The air just next to the pipe is sucked in , and air from all directions moves in to replace it . When air is blown out , it 's being pushed in a particular direction and carries on in that direction rather than spreading in all directions . In that one direction , you can feel the effect over a longer distance .","This is quite hard to ELY5 but I 'll try . I 'll give a short answer and if people are interested I 'll write a longer more scientific answer . Short answer : The long straight shaft of the hoover ensures that once the air leaves the end it is all travelling pretty much in the same direction ( straight ) and therefore takes a few metres of air to travel through before you no longer feel the push . ( This effect works like a rifle barrel ) When sucking , air enters the end from all different directions . Even if the same amount of air particles may enter the hoover as there are when leaving it , the sensation of sucking at any point will feel less as the air is being sucked from all directions , as when blowing the air is blown mostly in one direction . Think of having a torch ; if you look staright at the torch when it is on , it will be much brighter than if you took the torch parts of and stared straight at the bulb . The torch is emitting the same amount of light but without the mirrors to focus it , so it is spead out evenly in all directions rather than on one paticular point .

Here are a few examples: \n1. Carbon dating: This is a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as bones or artifacts made of wood or other organic materials. It works by measuring the amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, in the material. The amount of carbon-14 decreases over time, so by measuring how much is left, scientists can determine how old the material is. \n2. Document analysis: Historians often study the language, style, and handwriting of historical documents to determine their age and authenticity. They may also examine the materials the document is written on and the ink used to see if they are consistent with the time period the document is supposed to be from. \n3. Archaeology: Archaeologists study physical remains, such as artifacts and structures, to learn about the past. They can use various techniques, such as carbon dating and stratigraphy (the study of layers of soil or sediment), to determine the age of the remains they find. \n4. Eyewitness accounts: Some historical events were recorded by people who witnessed them firsthand. These accounts can be valuable sources of information, but they must be carefully evaluated to determine their reliability. \n5. Comparison with other historical accounts: Historians often compare different accounts of the same event to see if they agree with each other and to get a more complete understanding of what happened. \nBy using a combination of these and other methods, historians are able to validate the accuracy of historical accounts and determine the ages of historical events and documents."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, you know how when you get a test back from your teacher and they mark the answers you got wrong?

There are actually different ways in which genetic code will be expressed depending on the environment that the creature finds itself ; this phenomenon is called epigenetics .

So just as an example to illustrate the point , say that a pig is in a farm and is fed and shielded from predators . The chemical profile of this pig might show low levels of testosterone because there had not been any circumstances that would have precipitated the production of excess testosterone .

This contract is legally binding, which means that if you don't pay your debt as agreed, the lender can take action to try to get their money back. This might include sending your account to collections, suing you in court, or garnishing your wages (which means they can take a portion of your paycheck to pay off your debt). \nSecond, even if a large group of people all decided not to pay their debts at the same time, it's not clear what the outcome would be. It's possible that lenders would be unable to collect on their debts and might have to write them off as losses, which could cause them financial difficulties. This could lead to higher interest rates or stricter lending requirements for everyone in the future, as lenders try to mitigate the risk of default. \nFinally, there might be consequences for individual consumers who don't pay their debts.

{"question":"How is Lizard Squad hacking XBOX Live ? I just do n't understand how a multi - billion dollar corporation like Microsoft can be hacked by a few 20 somethings . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Lizard squad is using a technique called a \" Distributed Denial of Service . \" This is n't a hack or an act of \" breaking into \" a computer - network system . Instead the goal is to clog up the bandwidth available to people to access the system . You can think of it as a public pool on a hot summer day . The pool is a service with a maximum number of people who can be in and swimming at one time . On most days it has a fair number of people who are in swimming around and on others it may have fewer . Sometimes it is closed for maintenance . Then there 's that day when too many people are there . You 're in the queue to get in but it 's hard to establish any kind of order . People are pushing and shoving to get through first and many are frustrated when they do get in because the pool is already full . As soon as one person gets out another two or three fight over the spot . And what 's worse is a lot of the people in the pool are n't even doing anything but standing around . * * A DDoS takes a large volume of computers and other devices that can access the internet and continuously sends requests towards a target . * * Xbox Live is a service with many servers in many locations , implying that an attack like this has taken some time to prepare and execute . The computers in the DDoS only have to send as many \" requests \" as they can each second . They do n't have to wait for responses from the Xbox Live servers , * * they just have to send so many requests that the servers can not keep up , effectively preventing others from accessing this service . * *","I think we should also explain how to stop these attacks and why even with billions of dollars , it can be difficult to completely negate these attacks . One way to protect a network from DDOS is to just have LOTS and LOTS of bandwidth and spread your information over LOTS of servers . which of course takes LOTS of money . Another is of course proper network security , a firewall looks for and blocks non important or false network traffic , they try to filter out basic attacks and block repeat signals so that you can free up bandwidth and make yourself harder to hit . Of course the big corporations have very expensive and well maintained firewalls , but no wall is immune if the attacker is dedicated , persistent and willing to do the work . and the last ability a company has to defend themselves are their network maintainers / defenders . These people are supposed to be able to see the attacks as they come in and modify the firewall to customize it against the attacks coming in . Most hacking attempts , specially BOT nets , use a one size fits all attack . Each computer firing the same type of \" ammunition \" so a skilled defender can see the pattern and tell the firewall to ignore those packets . But it requires a lot of skill and costs a lot of money to maintain a full time skilled network defense . Most companies have an outside source that they can call upon to protect their networks . Once the attack occurs , they can call up the company to have someone come out to fix the wall and stop the attack . You 'll also notice that most of these attacks are only for a few hours at most and that 's why . It takes time to figure out the attack and patch the firewall to stop it , but it will happen sooner or later . But that 's why even billion dollar tech companies can be targeted and shut down . it wo n't last long , but when you are talking losing millions in sales and such , and also spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to stop it it is sometimes worth just paying them to not hit you . Hope this clears up some other questions that might come up .","It 's getting fucking annoying that 's for sure .

It is not clear exactly how they were able to hack Xbox Live, but it is likely that they exploited vulnerabilities in the system or found ways to bypass security measures. \nHacking is the act of accessing computer systems or networks without proper authorization. Hackers use a variety of techniques, such as writing and using malicious software (also known as malware), exploiting vulnerabilities in software or systems, or using social engineering techniques to trick people into revealing sensitive information. \nIt is important to note that even large, well-established companies like Microsoft can be vulnerable to hacking attacks.

{"question":"Why is hard drive formatting so inefficient ? I have a 750 GB hard drive on my laptop but only 700 GB are \" free \" . Why am I losing 1/15th of my hard drive space ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["It 's different definitions of GB . Hard drive manufacturers say that a gigabyte is 1000x1000x1000 bytes , while Windows says that it 's 1024x1023x1024 bytes . 750 GB by the first definition is about 700 GB by the second , so that 's what Windows shows . We 're now supposed to use gigabyte and GB only to mean the first definition , and call the second a gibibyte ( GiB ) . Old habits die hard though , since we 'd been using kilobyte to mean 1024 bytes for decades .","there are 2 parts that contributes to this : 1 . One \" marketing GB \" is 1000 MB , while one \" real GB \" is 1024 MB . 2 . The huge table of all free blocks , all files , etc must be stored somewhere . FAT filesystem is really unefficient for such large disks , for example .","The capacity of 750 Gb is listed as if it all was directly accessible , thereby giving you 805,306,368,000 bytes ( a byte is the smallest single piece of information that represents a usable character ) . But it is not that simple . All hard drives have their built in controller , which uses a small amount of the hard drive space to keep an index of the files on the drive . All operating systems have some sort of index of the files on the hard drive , on the hard drive itself , thereby using up some more of the free space . And the hard drive space is not used up very well , by default . Most operating systems will start writing a file in the next empty spot , even if the file is bigger than that location . It then breaks the file up and continues writing it in the next empty spot , and repeat until the file is written . Every break in the file is the same as having to write another file , as far as the info needed to keep track of all the parts of the file , which uses up more space that is now not available to the user . Then , files themselves are not always exactly the size of the smallest allowed data chunk . So if a file is 4352 Megabytes and the minimum data size is 1024 Kilobytes , then that extra 256 Kilobytes takes up a partial 1024 Kilobytes and the rest of it is unavailable for writing , thereby reducing available space even more . TL;DR Hard drives and operating systems use hard drive space for their own purposes and your data gets written to the drive in a way that wastes space ."],"chatgpt_answers":["When a hard drive is formatted, some of the space on the drive is reserved for the file system and other system files. This means that the drive will appear to have less total capacity than it actually does. \nFor example, if you have a 750 GB hard drive, the actual capacity of the drive is 750 billion bytes. However, when the drive is formatted, some of that space is set aside for the file system and other system files, so it may appear that only 700 GB are available for use. \nThis is a normal part of how hard drives and file systems work, and it is necessary in order to ensure that the drive can function properly and efficiently. The amount of space that is reserved for the file system and other system files will depend on the size of the drive and the type of file system being used. \nI hope this helps to explain why hard drive formatting can be inefficient in terms of the amount of space that is available for use.

You go there today and you do n't see it , but Brevard County in the 1940s was a bunch of orchards and hardly anything else .

This is one of the problems that [ the Soviet Union ] had with Baikonur [ Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan ] , their launch site . I mean , it is in the middle of nowhere .

It is n't that so much of DNA is devoted to reproduction that any one mutation is likely to damage that section of the DNA . It 's that , of all the mutations that happen , the ones that can survive and reproduce are necessarily the ones that alter the normal reproduction / cell death processes ( and these are the mutations that cause cancer . )","Other mutations exist , but one cell having some odd mutation does n't do much .

And , of course , it has to be structurally sound . The plane in the picture would probably collapse . The wings are creating drag , so they are all being pushed backward , and those skinny pylons would likely break . On top of that , the drag would be trying to tip the plane backward .

Multiple wings do work , and did for all of WWI , but a more powerful engine , a stronger single wing , and a swept back wing shape are all designed for strength and efficiency .

Your question is sort of like asking why do n't cars have 8 wheels . Early airplane prototypes lacked solid aerodynamic information for how to design wings and , as a result , had very inefficient wings ( very little lift generated ) . Rather than redesign the wings , many early aviators simply tried adding more wings . Of course , the problem with this was making sure that the structure to support all the wings was strong enough , which it often was n't . For example , here 's some newsreel footage of the same plane in the image you linked ( the [ Gerhardt Cycleplane ] ( URL_1 ) ): URL_0 Once aerodynamics were more well - understood , the need for multiple wings declined and eventually disappeared . It 's also worth noting that planes with multiple sets of wings can have problems if one set produces much more lift than the others . The Fokker Dr. I ( better known as simply the \" Fokker Triplane \" or the \" Red Baron 's plane \" ) , for example , had problems with the top wing producing so much more lift than the other two wings that the top wing would rip itself off of the aircraft at high speeds . This behavior tended to cause problems and was one of many reasons why , despite its prevalence in popular lore , the Dr. I saw only limited use in actual combat .

One reason is that they are more complex and expensive to build than planes with fewer wings. They also tend to be heavier and less efficient, which means that they require more power to fly and use more fuel. \nPlanes with two wings, or \"biplanes,\" were the most common design in the early days of aviation.

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Going to a grand jury * is * part of a normal trial ( at least for some kinds of cases ; it varies by state ) . A grand jury is a group of people that the prosecutor has to convince he has a case . He does n't have to prove that the defendant is guilty , just that there 's enough evidence that it 's OK to bring charges against them . The idea here is that the trial itself should not be inflicted upon someone who is obviously innocent — bringing charges must not be a weapon against innocent charges . Charging innocent people can still happen , but this step is intended to minimize it . The controversy is that generally grand juries are very easy to convince and many see them as a formality more than anything . When a high profile case does n't get an indictment ( i.e. a formal accusation against someone that a crime was committed ; pronounced in - dight - ment ) it raises a question of whether the prosecutor was really trying to get the grand jury to indict . Many feel that even though the officer in the Ferguson case would likely have been found innocent that it was not the prosecutor 's place to present such a weak case to the grand jury in order to stop the case then and there .","The constitution says : > No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger In otherwords : Someone accused of committing murder has to have a Grand Jury say there 's probable cause for a trial . So : Step 1 : Grand Jury : is there enough evidence to have a trial for murder . Step 2 : Regular Jury : is he guilty of murder ? You do n't hear about Grand Juries because in over 99 % of cases brought , Grand Juries indict . Partially , because you only need 12 of 16 - 23 members to support indictment . At the federal level , [ 538 reports ] ( URL_0 ) 161,989 of 162,000 federal grand juries indict .","The grand jury is a preliminary proceeding for the purpose of deciding whether there is a good enough reason to have a trial . The difference between a grand jury and a normal jury ( i.e. , a trial ) is that a grand jury is a closed , one - sided hearing where the prosecutor is tasked with demonstrating that there is probable cause to believe that a defendant committed the particular crime . Usually , a two - thirds supermajority agreement among the jurors is required to \" indict \" the defendant ( i.e. , two - thirds of the jurors must agree that there exists probable cause to believe the defendant committed a crime , thus warranting a full trial ) . If two - thirds of the jurors indict the defendant , it does not mean he is convicted . It means there is enough evidence that there should be a full trial . Unlike during the grand jury , at a full trial the defendant enjoys his sixth amendment rights to counsel , to confront his accusers , and to a public proceeding . What I mean is that during a grand jury the defendant has no right to call his own witnesses , nor cross - examine witnesses that testify against him ( or more accurately have a lawyer do those things ) , and he has no right to public oversight . During a trial the defendant has a right to a lawyer , who can introduce evidence and call witnesses on his behalf and cross - examine opposing witnesses in an a hearing opened to public oversight . Also , the trial requires the jury to unanimously vote that he committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict him . This is a much harder standard than the grand jury 's 2/3 's majority vote for probable cause . It 's also worth noting that not all states employ grand juries . For example , in my state a preliminary hearing substitutes for the grand jury . During my state 's preliminary hearings , the prosecutor is tasked with introducing evidence before a judge ( without a jury ) , and the defendant has the right to have a lawyer argue against that evidence and cross examine the prosecutor 's witnesses . In this scenario the judge ( and not a jury ) decides whether there is enough probable cause for the case to go to trial . This is not to say that some states only do grand juries , and other states only do preliminary hearings . My state has certain policies where it will use a grand jury rather than a preliminary hearing , e.g. , where there is a danger of witness intimidation . I do n't know whether my state would use a grand jury for a capital case against a cop . Technically it would be at the District Attorney 's discretion , but it 's probably really just politics . Also , it should be noted that the rules regarding whether or not there must be a grand jury is different in federal courts . The fifth amendment preserves a defendant 's right to a grand jury for all \" capital , or otherwise infamous crime[s ] \" in federal courts . To sum it up , a grand jury is a process with a very low burden of proof for the purpose of deciding whether a full trial is necessary . Some states use preliminary hearings more often .

Tires also have a sidewall, which is the part of the tire that you can see between the tread and the wheel. The sidewall has important information printed on it, like the size of the tire and the maximum load and speed it can handle. \nNow, let's talk about some of the factors that can make one tire better than another: \n1. Performance: Some tires are designed for specific types of driving or weather conditions. For example, you might want a tire with a softer compound for better grip on a race track, or a tire with a lot of tread for better traction in the rain. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions tend to cost more because they require more advanced materials and engineering. \n2. Quality: Tires can also vary in terms of quality, which can affect their performance and lifespan. Higher-quality tires are typically made with better materials and more advanced manufacturing processes, which can make them last longer and perform better. These tires tend to cost more, but they can save you money in the long run because you won't have to replace them as often. \n3. Brand: The brand of the tire can also affect the price. Some tire brands are known for making high-quality, high-performance tires that come with a higher price tag. Other brands might offer more budget-friendly options that may not have the same level of performance or quality. \nSo, to sum it up: tires can vary in price based on their performance, quality, and brand.

However, the processing of white rice is simpler and requires fewer steps, which makes it cheaper to produce. The demand for white rice is also generally higher than that for brown rice, particularly in many developing countries where it is a staple food. This higher demand can also contribute to the lower price of white rice."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Hi there! So, white rice is actually cheaper than brown rice because it goes through a process called milling that removes the outer bran layer and germ of the rice grain.

{"question":"Why do multistory office buildings and skyscraper like buildings keep their lights on all the time ? Can someone explain why we are n't saving tons of money by cutting these damn office lights off at night ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Because work goes on virtually every hour of every day in high rises . The office critters occupy and push papers and make up money during the daylight and sometimes into the evening . And Overnight / early morning there are cleaning crews maintenance / repair crews and construction crews and security people wandering about . The tenants in highrise office buildings are constantly changing , whenever a new tenant moves into a floor or subdivides a floor into multiple offices the work on the build out ca n't happen during the day since office critters would get upset if construction men were walking all over their desks and shifting stuff around while they were there . My company occasionally does high rise tenant finish and when the tenant wants a new break room or two , and the executive wants a private bathroom in his corner office then things need to be happening on multiple floors at once . The drainage piping needs to be run on the floor below , which is likely occupied . To install new drainage plumbing in a high rise a large X - ray machine needs to be brought out and shoot beams of radiation up towards the slab to find what locations are available for drilling , ( this needs to be done from the floor below ) then we bring out large core drills which make lots of noise and spray mud everywhere , which requires us to cover all the office folks computers and desks / cabinets and family photos with tarps so when they get back in the morning they do n't know we were romping around their office the previous night . Then we need to take the ceiling grid panels out from the occupied floor and bring in the equipment to install the new piping . Doing any of this during ' working hours ' , everything from bringing in large radiation machines and blasting them between their desks , to covering everyone with tarps and spraying them with mud which making a racket , would piss loads of workers off . Work like what I 'm describing will mean that three floors are completely lit up for the entire night shift , if it 's a 35 story building and 2 - 3 floors are being re - finished and there are two cleaning crews and a security / maintenance crew going around as well then that would mean 10 - 12 floors at a time minimum are lit up so people are able to work . Tl , DR : If the lights are on on a certain floor of a highrise , there are people doing some form of work on that floor , if there are no lights or the lights are dim then the floor is unoccupied at that time . I 've also heard rumors that tall buildings need to keep a certain amount of floors lit up so aeroplanes can see then easier and gauge their height / distance at night .

Convenience: Some people might be working late or overnight in the building, and they might need the lights on to do their work. \n4. Energy efficiency: In some cases, the lights in office buildings and skyscrapers might be designed to be energy efficient, so they don't use as much energy as you might think. Additionally, turning the lights off and on frequently can actually use more energy than leaving them on, because it takes energy to start up the lighting system each time it is turned on. \n5. Cost: Finally, it might be more expensive to turn the lights off and on all the time than to just leave them on. This is because each time the lights are turned on and off, it causes wear and tear on the lighting system, which can shorten its lifespan and increase maintenance costs. \nOverall, there are a number of factors to consider when deciding whether to keep the lights on in an office building or skyscraper, and it's not always as simple as just turning them off to save money."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well kiddo, the thing about these big, tall buildings is that they have lots of different companies and people working inside them.

Part of the problem with the perception of our debt being a big problem is that the numbers are big . Mind bogglingly big . Scary big . Our debt is roughly $ 17,000,000,000,000 . And , yes , that is a big number . But let me show you another number : $ 17,000,000,000,000 . Why , yes . That is the same number . $ 17,000,000,000,000 also happens to be our Gross Domestic Product or GDP , which is what our country produces in a year . Think of the GDP as our annual salary as a country . Now if you met a person who made $ 170,000 a year ( a much easier number to get your head around ) and that person was in debt to the tune of $ 170,000 say with a house a couple of credit cards and that person always paid all of his bills all the time , most people would say that person has very good credit and is n't at risk of going bankrupt and would likely be a particularly good candidate if they decided to get another loan . And so long as their income grows proportionally with their debt and they keep paying their bills , they 'll continue to be a safe bet to continue to receive loans . In other words , if their debt rose to $ 200,000 , that 'd be okay if their income was also in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 . Now what you want to know is : Can the debt ever be repaid ? And the simple answer is , \" yes , but you would n't really want to \" . Keeping our house metaphor in tact for the time being , if we wanted to get out of debt , we could pay less for the stuff we use and use the difference to pay down our debt . But there 's a problem : What do we cut ? Food ? Medicine ? Clothing ? Home Security ? Everything we 're spending money on we more or less need . Sure , we could nibble around the edges and find a few dollars here and there , but not enough to make a really big difference . Going back to our full scale US debt , it sounds good to say you 're going to cut our $ 10 million budget for ketchup research or $ 6 million in pork for a courthouse in Milwaukee , but that 's like saying you 're going to pay off your mortgage by rummaging around for spare change in your couch . When trillions are on the table , millions wo n't cut it and billions will barely touch it . Which is n't to say it 's impossible . Just about 20 years ago the Clinton administration had a plan to pay down the national debt by raising taxes and cutting spending . According to that plan , we would have paid off the national debt by the far off future year of 2011 .

The debt is currently about $28 trillion and it is possible for it to be repaid, but it would require the government to make regular payments to its creditors to reduce the balance. \nThere are a few ways that the government could make these payments: \n1. By running budget surpluses: This means that the government would bring in more money through taxes and other revenues than it spends on things like defense, education, and healthcare. The extra money could be used to pay down the debt. \n2. By selling assets: The government could sell things like land, buildings, or other assets to raise money to pay off the debt. \n3. By growing the economy: If the economy grows, the government will bring in more money through taxes, which could be used to pay down the debt. \nIt is important to note that the national debt is not necessarily a bad thing.

The amount of water passing through any given section of the hose at any point in time has not changed at all , but by shrinking the opening with your thumb , in order to keep the current constant , the water has to speed up coming out the end , which lets you [ spray your backyard enemies ] ( URL_1 ) with a more effective water laser .

As you can see , the left side has fewer turns than the right side . The electrons in the wire on the right are influenced by the magnetic field created by the ones on the left , and they begin moving . This creates an \" induced \" current in the right side . Energy must be conserved ! Because there are more coils on the right , there are more electrons under the influence than you started with ! So the voltage decreases ( or increases ) based on how many turns of wire are wrapped around each side . Unfortunately , there is one discrepancy with the hose analogy- the current in the wire has to increase if the voltage decreases , ( so that energy is conserved across the transformer ) and vise versa .

( It 's been a looong time since undergrad so if I 've bungled it anyone is welcome to correct me )","Magnetic fields induce voltage into conductors ( like copper wire ) . To increase a magnetic field , one trick is to coil copper wire . The flow of electricity creates a magnetic field along the length of the wire , but it is relatively weak . If you coil the wire , the field compounds it 's effects and changes it 's magnetic flow to be around the entire coil instead of the wire alone . Certain materials are also used to further increase magnetism by allowing magnetic field lines to move . Like electricity , magnetic field flux lines move through materials differently . Magnetic field flow is called reluctance . Iron is very reluctant , and allows the magnet field lines to become stronger .

The primary coil is connected to a source of electricity, such as a power outlet, and the secondary coil is connected to a device that needs electricity, such as a lamp. \nWhen electricity flows through the primary coil, it creates a magnetic field around the coil.

You just have basic cable at the very least which makes you think it 's free . You still pay for it in the same way that CNN or ESPN are not * free * .

ESPN / TNT / ABC pay a combined $ 2.6 billion for the NBA plus all of the local contracts ( some are quite lucrative like in LA or NYC ) . Boxing and MMA do n't have contracts with those stations ( mainly because they are considered worth it for the major stations ) so they do PPV . The benefit of PPV is that you can charge more PER PERSON than the NFL or NBA does however you also can not build out your audience the same way that the big 4 sports can .

As we all know the NFL is the king of this as they go to commercial after every change of possession ( sometimes twice like on a kickoff ) . This results in tons of commercialization of the game . The NBA is similar since there are so many timeouts and the MLB is predictable with its innings so it can go to commercial multiple times . The NHL is n't as popular in the USA .

Soap operas are known for having long, ongoing storylines that unfold over the course of many episodes or even years. They often feature a large cast of characters who are interconnected and have complicated relationships with each other. This can make it easy to recognize a soap opera even if you haven't seen it before. \nFinally, soap operas are often identified by their genre. Soap operas are a type of drama that focuses on the personal and professional lives of characters who are usually in their 20s to 40s and are often upper-middle class or wealthy.

The digestive tract of an herbivore is different from a human 's , allowing them to process that volume of plant matter quickly and without using much energy , and also getting nutrients from it that human 's ca n't . For a vegan human to have a lot of muscle mass is possible , but more difficult . Mainly , they have to focus on eating high protein plants like nuts and beans .","Different species are able to synthesize different nutrients themselves through cellular processes . Nutrients include carbohydrates , fats , proteins ( or their building blocks , amino acids ) , and vitamins . This means instead of the body having to \" eat \" the protein containing a particular amino acid , the cell itself can make that amnio acid . This of course requires energy and work by the cell . Conversely , \" a nutrient is said to be \" essential \" if it must be obtained from an external source , either because the organism can not synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities \" . So there are two kinds of nutrients , those that we can make through our own cellular processes , and those we must obtain through our diet . [ Proteins ] ( URL_2 ) are made up of different [ amnio acids ] ( URL_3 ) . A good analogy is that a protein is like a train , and the individual cars are amnio - acids . Different combinations of railcars , in different orders give different kinds of trains . In the same way , different amnio - acids , in different combinations give different kinds of proteins . Digestion , be it in animals or humans , results in the breakdown proteins into their amnio acid components . The intestine absorbs the individual amnio acids and the body ships these amnio acids to the cells . Cellular processes rearrange the amnio acids in new ways to make new proteins that are used by the animal or human for various bodily functions . So think of the cell as the railyard where new trains ( proteins ) are made but reassembling the cars ( amnio - acids ) into new and different combinations . \" Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms , including catalyzing metabolic reactions , replicating DNA , responding to stimuli , and transporting molecules from one location to another . \" There are [ nine essential amino acids ] ( URL_1 ) that humans must consume in their diet because our cells can not make them through cellular processes . The rest we can make ourselves in our cells . This means that our diet must meet these minimum essential amnio acids requirements in order for us to survive . We can not make the nine , we must consume the nine . The nine are found in all kinds of foods , from plants to meat which is why humans can have such a wide variety of diets ( e.g. vegetarian , vegan , allergen - accomidating ) and still function normally . However , other animals have different essential nutritional requirements . For example , [ cats , unlike humans , can not synthesize the amino acid taurine so it must be added to their diet ] ( URL_0 ) . Some species are able to synthesize Vitamin C and do not need to consume it in their diet ( e.g. mice ) , whereas humans can not synthesize Vitamin C and thus are required to consume it in our diet . These differences in essential nutrient intake creates different dietary requirements for different species and results in different types of foods being consumed preferentially by different species . This is why a horse is able to survive and thrive just on plant material , whereas we are required to consume a more varied diet . They obtain all their unique essential nutrients from their herbivore diet . So other species have different combinations of essential nutrients in order to sustain a balanced and healthy diet . This makes perfect sense , if all species had the exact same requirements there would be a lot of competition for the same food resources . By diversifying what is essential to consume , there is less competition . Remember that it is costly for the body to produce its own nutrients through cellular processes . It is much easier to just consume an amnio acid than produce it . Thus , if a particular amino acid or nutrient is abundant and easily available in a species environment it makes more sense for natural selection to select against the cell 's producing that nutrient , and for the individual to simply consume it . For example , most primates - including humans - do not synthesize vitamin C. This makes perfect sense since vitamin C is easily acquired through our collective diets by consuming fruit . Fruit is abundant resource in most primate 's environments thus vitamin C would not be hard to acquire . So each species is balancing what they need to eat , and what they can produce themselves , along with what is available to them in their environment .","Herbivores have multiple stomachs with different enzymes that allow them to extract nutrition from fiber . Humans do not . Plus herbivores eat for up to half their lives , chomping on uncooked grasses and such . They did a test where some humans were given a diet equivalent to a gorilla , for a week . They spent ~8 hours chomping on raw vegetables , and by the end they were lethargic and malnourished . The human body simply ca n't sustain itself on raw vegetables . We evolved through cooking an omnivorous diet ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Herbivores like wild horses can acquire a lot of muscle mass by eating a lot of grass because grass contains a good amount of nutrients that the body needs to grow and maintain muscle mass. These nutrients include proteins, which are important for building and repairing muscle tissue, and carbohydrates, which provide the body with energy to support physical activity. \nIt is possible for a vegan human to maintain high muscle mass by eating a varied and balanced diet that includes a good source of plant-based proteins and carbohydrates. Some examples of plant-based proteins that can help build and maintain muscle mass include beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, nuts, and seeds. It is also important for vegans to make sure they are getting enough calories and nutrients from other sources, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to support muscle growth and maintenance. \nHowever, it is generally easier for people who eat animal products, such as meat, eggs, and dairy, to get enough protein and other nutrients to support muscle mass because these sources of protein are typically more easily digestible and contain a more complete set of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein.

So here you have a market who wants your product and wants it now , and ca n't or wo n't afford it . I 'm not saying it 's ok , but this is the catalyst that allows people to justify it .

{"question":"Why do online videos stream flawlessly on my computer but why do GIFs seem to load like a 1080p movie through a 56k modem ? ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["tl;dr : GIF is an image compression format , which is n't really suited well to compressing video data . Basically the only advantage is that browsers support the format natively without loading plugins . Actual videos compressed with video encoders are way more efficient . --- In an animated GIF , each frame of the animation is encoded as a separate file , and then the files are more or less just stuck together in the final animation . You can do something similar with JPEG ( Motion JPEG ) , although it 's not supported by browsers in quite the same way as GIFs . Also GIFs do a better job of compressing line art rather than photographs . Thus , making a video out of GIF images yields pretty poor compression anyhow . In an encoded video file , the video compressor takes into account that successive frames are ( probably ) related to each other . The first frame is encoded completely , in a similar ( but more advanced ) method as a JPEG might be . However , the next frame is typically encoded as just the difference from the first frame to the second . This is way more efficient for most videos where motion happens slowly . Say the video is of a ball falling . In an animated GIF , each frame is a standalone , complete picture of the ball and any surroundings . It 's compressed rather poorly , and a lot of redundant information is sent , so each individual frame is very large . In a video encoded with a video codec ( MPEG1 , MPEG2 , MPEG4 , h.264 , h,265 , etc ) , the first frame is compressed somewhat similarly to a JPEG . Then the second frame basically says \" see the region of the first frame where the ball is ? Move that down a bit . Fill in the background with this information . \" - This frame is * way * smaller and easier to transmit than the first frame . It 's also easier and faster to decode . There are some drawbacks to the video compression approach , but in general it does a way better job of representing the video data with way fewer bits . --- EDIT : Wow , this is getting a lot of attention :) I left out a lot of stuff to keep the answer simple , but I 'm getting pinged about a lot of the same things over and over , so here 's a few quick additions : - Yes , compression algorithm differences matter as well . I said something to this effect , but to extend : GIF uses a compression method that works well for color patterns , and video encoders use something that works better for photographs / live video . I did n't try to explain DCT / Quantization / entropy coding since that 's a super technical topic for ELI5 . - Yes , GIF can represent a simple delta between two frames . However , in the case of video data , it is rare that this is useful . Someone asked for a more detailed explanation of this , [ my response is here ] ( URL_1 ) . - Yes , there may be other factors at work besides the bitrate / coding issues . I think it is safe to say that GIF is a terrible video compression format , and that 's probably the root of many other issues . However , I have n't profiled browsers to see where they spend time decoding animated GIFs . I made a list of other places that could be inefficient [ here ] ( URL_0 ) . - Yeah , your \" five year old did n't understand this \" el - oh - el :P If my 7 - yr - old had the interest I 'd try to explain it to him and get his feedback , but I think he 'd rather play LEGO . --- EDIT 2 : A couple more things people are asking / mentioning : - Several people have mentioned HTML5 Video and WebM as alternatives to animated GIFs . There 's a lot of back - and - forth , legal issues , competitors refusing to agree and so forth that is really hampering the HTML5 video tag . [ Wikipedia has a long article on the subject . ] ( URL_2 ) We 've had better video technology than GIF for years and GIF is still going strong . I think we 're stuck with it , despite it being a terrible technology for the problem . ( See also : practically every other technology used on the web ) - A common question is \" So does this mean that simpler videos with less movement will be encoded to smaller file sizes ? Or that complex or really random videos make larger or less efficient video files ? \" The answer to this somewhat depends on the encoder settings , but in general the answer is yes . If you encode a simple video with little motion it will take less data than a more complex video with a lot of motion and random stuff going on . Modern video encoders are tuned towards encoding video sequences from cameras . They make assumptions based on what the real world looks like most of the time , and use those assumptions to compress more efficiently . They also take into account what our eyes are good at seeing .","Short answer : videos use better compression techniques than GIFs . GIF was originally designed as a still image format , with the animation capability kind of shoehorned in later . Video uses compression techniques that were designed specifically for video . This means the file size of a GIF is much bigger than an equivalent video ( often 5x to 10x bigger ) , so it takes much longer to download . Long answer : Think of a GIF like a flipbook . It 's a series of still pictures that when played quickly , look like a video . You need to download each one of those still pictures . Each frame is compressed , but little is done to take advantage of the fact that one frame is probably very similar to the next frame ( there are some minor optimizations done though -- for instance if the background of a frame does n't change at all from one frame to the next , that background wo n't be sent to you every time ) . Video uses much better compression techniques . Each frame is compressed like in a GIF , but frames are also compared to the one before and the one after . Just like in a GIF , if the background does n't change it wo n't be sent to you every time . But there are also more clever things that can be done -- say a car is moving from left to right in your video . Video compressors will basically say \" hey that car that was over there in the last frame , just move it to the right 5 pixels \" . So you take the image of the car you already have , shift it to the right , and that 's your next frame . GIF ca n't do this . Since a lot of video consists of smooth motion similar to this , videos compress very well . This is called [ motion compensation ] ( URL_0 ) . There are a number of other issues at play here too : * The compression technology used by GIF is far older than modern video compression , so that the compression achieved by each individual frame is better with modern videos . The LZW compression technique used in GIF is 30 + years old , for instance . * GIF uses lossless compression , whereas most videos use [ lossy compression ] ( URL_1 ) -- basically the video compressor throws away data that you 're probably not going to notice anyway . And even if you do notice it , chances are it 's still good enough to get the point across . ( JPEG is another example of a lossy compression scheme that you 're probably familiar with . ) * Along with this , video compressors throw away some color information as well . This one is harder to explain easily , but basically your eye is better at noticing changes in brightness rather than changes in color . So the compressor looks at the brightness and color of every pixel . When it comes time to write out the video , it stores the brightness for every pixel , but only stores the color for every 4th pixel . The other 3 pixels share that same color . Hopefully that made some amount of sense . It 's called [ Chroma subsampling ] ( URL_2 ) if you 'd like to read more . All that adds up to better compression for video , which means smaller file sizes , which means faster downloads .

If we are talking about things like number of children or relative decision - making power within the community as criteria of wealth , than maybe that context works for prehistoric societies . In the most basic context , wealth may have equalled power . The more power you have , the more likely you are to get the best things as they were gathered / hunted / made .

{"question":"Why does live TV look different from pre - filmed TV , even when they are broadcast at the same quality ? Case in point : 30 rock live episodes vs normal episodes . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["You have a lot of time to do post - processing when it 's not live . That 's a main reason a movie is released months after filming has completed .","Basically , you can move the lights around between camera setups , and you can color correct . In normal \" single camera \" shooting ( Like a normal 30 Rock episode ) , you can and do tweak the lighting pretty much every time you move the camera . Shooting live , you need a flatter \" general purpose \" lighting setup that will work okay for every angle but does n't necessarily look amazing at any angle . You also need all lights above the set and out of the field of view of the cameras in live production , whereas in single camera you can have a light or reflector just off camera for a nice effect . You can get the actors to shift their positions to get better shots . You can refresh makeup between takes . All sorts of little subtle things that you 'd never think of if you 've never been on a set because the end result makes it all look like it happens naturally . In live production , you ca n't change your mind about anything once the show starts . In many cases , you will also use different lenses in live production . In a single camera style shoot , you will have a person dedicated to focusing the camera . ( Focus Puller , or 1st Assistant Camera Operator . ) So , if you want to have nice soft blurry backgrounds that make the subject \" pop \" in the frame , you can shoot with \" wide open \" lenses so only the actor is in focus . To do that , you need to rehearse any camera or actor moves so the focus puller knows how to move the focus setting on the lens through the course of the shot . Autofocus is n't good enough because it does n't always know which thing should be in focus , and if it gets confused it may make the whole picture go blurry and useless for a bit which ruins the shot . The 1AC may need to use a measuring tape to check the exact distance between the camera and the actor to make sure things are exactly in focus , which requires walking into the camera 's field of view during shot setup . Obviously during live production you ca n't have somebody stopping the scene to measure , or repeating a take because focus was n't right so you \" stop down \" the lenses or use different lenses so you do n't get the nice soft background and more of the scene is in focus . When framing shots in single camera , you can put the camera right next to an actor 's face to get an interesting shot . But when shooting live , each camera has to stay out of the field of view of every other camera which limits how interesting and varied the shots can be that you can get . One camera person walking right up to an actor would be visible to the other cameras , ruining their shot in a live production so such gags would have to be * very * carefully planned . Then , in editing you would only pick the nicest looking takes , which is obviously impossible when shooting live . Then you send the project off to color correction where the image gets tweaked and refined until it looks like the director / DOP and colorist want it to . This is probably the biggest shift in the image that you are noticing , but it is the hardest to explain . Look for some colorist demo reels on vimeo , and you 'll see some idea of how much the image sometimes gets changed during coloring .","Two main reasons . One , the cameras used in Live TV are often smaller and lighter , with a single color processing chip that results in less color distinction . Cameras on set are either higher end with multiple color processors , or still use Film . Post processing on higher end cameras allows for more polishing and tailoring forthe final product . Two , live TV is typically recorded at 30 frames per second ( or higher ) . Classic film and TV are shot in 24p ( 24 frames per second ) . This is what gives the biggest difference in the \" feel \" of live vs others . This is also why newer 120Hz+ HDTVs have that akward unnatural feel if you 're watching a show shot in 24p but being displayed at much faster refresh rate .

The alcohol - based gels work by ruining the bacteria 's cell walls ; alcohol in high concentration is very lethal to nearly all bacteria . The outer layer of human skin is already dead , and a lot more resistant to being penetrated by alcohol ; the 30 seconds or so that you 're rubbing your hands is n't enough to get through that ( relatively ) thick layer of protein and other dead - cell bits .

It also strips your skin of some of its natural oils , which is why the hand gels usually have moisturizers in them . Related : Your stomach , and to some extent other parts of the digestive tract , is already protected against * some * chemicals because it 's such a strongly acidic environment anyway and it takes rapid cell replacement and a mucus layer to keep the acid from harming you .

{"question":"Existentialism ? What is existentialism ? I 'm having a difficult time understanding what it exactly means ( via Wikipedia ) . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Key Existential Concepts The meaninglessness of life , the absence of God , the loneliness of being a thinking individual — it sounds like the existentialists were n't the happiest group of folks , right ? Not necessarily true . Read on to get an idea of what existentialism is all about . Absurdity : What human beings encounter when they come into contact with the world . Absurdity is brought about because the human instinct to seek order and meaning is frustrated by the refusal of the world to be orderly or meaningful . Anxiety : Kierkegaard said , \" Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom . \" You feel anxiety because you recognize that you and you alone are responsible for your actions . This produces the two - sided feeling of simultaneous dread and exhilaration . Alienation : The sense that you 're a stranger in the world , or a stranger to yourself . Many aspects of existence can be alienating . One of the primary sources is absurdity . Ironically , the stories and systems developed by philosophy and religion to address that absurdity can be just as alienating . Existence precedes essence : Sartre 's phrase to describe the existential situation humans find themselves in . It refers to the fact that when you 're born , you have no meaning , no purpose , no definition . Human beings exist first , and only later define themselves . The Übermensch : The word Nietzsche uses to refer to his ideal human being . Literally \" overman , \" the word reflects the importance in his philosophy of overcoming — overcoming traditional values , overcoming the herd mentality , and , most importantly , overcoming yourself . You overcome these things so that you might attain something greater . Nietzsche 's Übermensch is an unconventional creator of values , a joyous free spirit , and one who embraces the earth instead of pining away for heaven . The death of God : The death of the notion that belief in God alone , or belief in any religious or philosophical system , is sufficient to provide human beings with the meaning , purpose , and definition they crave . It 's the recognition that , because no external system can provide you with the answers , you must take responsibility for providing them yourself . Subjectivity : Your first - person perspective on the world , including the needs , desires , and emotions that accompany that perspective . The existentialists take this as a valid and important starting point for genuinely human endeavors . This can be contrasted with the scientific mindset , which always starts with objectivity — seeing people in impersonal , objective terms without emotion or appreciation for their individual point of view .","\" You are five Johnny . Go play . \" That 's how you explain existentialism to a five year old .","Here 's are more simple view . Existentialism means that every person has an equal right to exist .

This means that we have the freedom to choose how we want to live, and that we are responsible for the choices we make. \nExistentialism also emphasizes the importance of individual experience and subjective perspective. It suggests that each person's experience of the world is unique, and that it is up to each individual to decide what is important and meaningful to them. \nExistentialism can be a difficult concept to understand, but one way to think about it is that it is a way of looking at the world that emphasizes the importance of being true to oneself and living a life that is meaningful to you."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Existentialism is a really big word but to put it in easy and simple terms - it's about asking big questions like who we are, why are we here?

The result is that the language has n't really changed that much . Whereas Chaucer ( 200 years before Shakespeare ) is almost impossible to a modern audience , Shakespeare and his contemporaries are quite understandable to a modern audience . And English has been standardised even more since then . Even in my lifetime I 've seen words which had different meanings in different places ( no - one uses the British billion any more ) become standardised , we 're increasingly using American spellings for things ( the British \" sceptic \" has fallen out of use , in favour of the American \" skeptic \" , with many British publishers preferring the second one ) .

{"question":"What is the trust fund loophole Obama mentioned in his SOTU address ? I keep hearing more about this trust fund loophole and I only kind of understand it . Can anyone explain it like I 'm 5 ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Not really ELI5 - able because it 's a complicated subject but : So , whenever you sell property ( subject to an insane number of rules ) you calculated the amount that you gained or lost on your investment , and if you had a gain ( called a \" capital gain \" ) they you pay taxes on that gain . As an example : you buy $ 10,000 worth of stock , then sell it a year later for $ 30,000 ( good investment ) and pay taxes on your $ 20,000 ( $ 30,000 - $ 10,000 ) profit . Now , for inherited items , this gets a little tricky . So instead of you buying that stock , lets say your grandfather bought it at $ 10,000 and when he died it was worth $ 25,000 , and when you finally sold it you got $ 30,000 for it . Under the current tax plan , you 're only required to pay taxes on a gain of $ 5,000 , because you 're allowed to use the value at the time of inheritance as your \" basis \" in the stock ( \" basis \" is the technical term for basically \" the value you calculate your gain / loss from \" ) . * * Under the new plan :* * you would instead pay taxes on the $ 20,000 gain , using the original $ 10,000 basis from the original purchase of the stock ( with exemptions of something like $ 250,000 per person , to spare the middle class ) . Also , note that capital gains have generally been taxed at a lower percentage than ordinary income ( currently 15 % for anyone in the 25 % income tax bracket or up ) , with the rationale being basically that this will encourage business investment . Of course , since many very rich people make the vast majority of their income in the form of capital gains and not salary , it also causes the famous case of billionaires paying lower tax rates than their secretaries ( see : Buffett , Warren ) . In a related proposal , Obama has suggest raising the capital gains rate to 28 % for couples with incomes in excess of $ 500,000 . Those two changes would result in the government raising a lot of extra revenue ( as well as long - term macroeconomic consequences that I am not qualified to speculate on ) . Source : I prepared taxes professionally for five years","Let 's say you buy stock at $ 10 . You hold it for 20 years , and now it 's worth $ 100 . Normally , when you sell that asset , you pay capital gains taxes on the $ 90 difference in price . Now , you put that stock into a trust and you drop dead before selling it . Your children crack the trust at the $ 100 level . When they sell it , they do n't pay the capital gains tax on the $ 90 profit , as they obtained it at the $ 100 level . Thus , all that income generated from the stock is never taxed at all . As a result , there 's $ 90 per share worth of taxes [ or , more accurately , 20 years of capital gains taxes ] just getting lost .","When you buy capital assets ( think of things like stocks ) , you have what is called a \" basis \" in that asset . Your basis is usually , with some exceptions , what you paid to purchase the asset . So for example , if you bought a share of stock for $ 100 , your basis in that share of stock is $ 100 . When you sell the stock later , if it is worth more than it was when you bought it , you have \" capital gain . \" The capital gain is the increase in value between your basis and the amount you sold it for . So in this example , lets say that 5 years later , the stock is worth $ 150 . When you sell this stock , you have $ 50 of capital gain . Here is the part that Obama calls the \" Trust Fund Loophole . \" When a person dies , then can give their capital assets to a relative . When they do this , the basis in the assets given is automatically changed to same value as the current value of the asset . So in our example , if the person did n't sell the stock , and instead gave it to their daughter when they died , the daughter now owns the stock and the basis is $ 150 . This is important because it allows the daughter to sell the stock immediately , and pay no capital gains taxes .

Humans call both the urge to create a relationship , and the urge to maintain relationships , \" love \" . All of our emotions are essentially simply our way of perceiving instinctual urges , or at least urges that are strong enough for us to notice them . edit : Animals that do not form mating bonds have different chemical receptors . The hormones that correspond to lust / love would have no effect on animals that do n't bond . Those hormones are related to pleasure / reward . So , for instance , if a prairie vole ( which forms bonds ) * either * mates or has the hormones injected , they will bond . A montane vole ( which does not bond ) could mate , and it does n't do anything . Inject the hormones that a prairie vole produces from mating , and it has no effect . They simply will not form bonds . Presumably , this bonding process is pleasurable , since the hormones are essentially providing a reward .","[ Affective neuroscience ] ( URL_1 ) is a very interesting area of study which examines \" the study of the neural mechanisms of emotion . This interdisciplinary field combines neuroscience with the psychological study of personality , emotion , and mood . \" It also examines how our own neural mechanisms are mirrored in animals ( and especially mammals ) because of shared ancestry . The study of motion is definitely a very active area of science that permeates many different fields - evolutionary biology , animal behaviour , human behaviour , animal communication , human communication , origin of communication , psychology , psychiatry , neurobiology ... each look at different questions concerning emotions . In ELI5 words this means that animals are certainly capable of feeling emotions because the neural mechanisms that produce emotions are conserved through evolution , and are similar to the neural mechanisms that produce emotions in ourselves . All mammals , being related through common ancestry , have even more similar and conserved mechanisms - humans are of course mammals too ! But a few things to note : 1 . The way animals express a particular emotion may differ from the way humans express that emotion . For example , humans often smile to exhibit happiness . But for the rest of the primate order smiling is either a signal of submissiveness or fear . This does not mean that other primates are incapable of feeling happiness , but that they very likely express it in different ways from ourselves . We also have to be very mindful that other animals , even cognitively complex ones , may be physically constrained and incapable of complex facial expressions . For example , we know dolphins are capable of a lot of complex cognitive tasks , they are able to identify themselves in the mirror and they may even have names for one another ... but they do n't have the facial musculature to make the expressions that are , well , as expressive as ours . Their emotions may not even be obvious for this reason , but that does n't mean they do n't exist . 2 . Humans like to make emotions poetic , like love . But love is simply a kind of attachment emotion . Humans become attached to each other and objects , sometimes to the point of obsession . Animals also become attached to each other . Mothers and their infants , bonding pairs of adults ... all forms of attachment exhibited in the animal kingdom .

A DJ does n't perform , he just plays music for people to enjoy , and often will put in some effort to craft a playlist ( sometimes on the fly ) that flows nicely , and have one track segue smoothly into the next . So that 's what some electronic music artists do live : they just DJ their own music . The music is 100 % premade , and they just play them in a particular order with a cool light show . You do n't really go to watch the artist so much as you go to hear the music on a big system with a hyped up crowd . Other artists , recognising that this is a little boring to play and to watch , add a live music element . They 'll actually have a keyboard or something with them , and play parts of the music live . Others will have a sampler loaded with tons of cool sounds , which they 'll throw in to keep things interesting . Still others will bring a remixing aspect in , using turntablism or sampling to remix their own music in real time .

Here are a few examples: \n1. Using a laptop or other computer: Many electronic music artists use a laptop or other computer to run software that allows them to play their music and create new sounds in real-time. They might use software like Ableton Live, which allows them to trigger pre-recorded samples and loops, or synthesizers and other virtual instruments to create new sounds on the fly. \n2. Using hardware synthesizers and drum machines: Some electronic music artists prefer to use hardware synthesizers and drum machines to create their sounds. These are physical devices that can be played like an instrument and can create a wide range of electronic sounds. \n3. Using a DJ controller: Some electronic music artists, especially those who make dance music, use a DJ controller to mix and match different tracks and create new music on the fly. A DJ controller is a device that looks like a mixer and is usually connected to a laptop or other computer, allowing the artist to manipulate the music using faders, knobs, and buttons. \n4. Using live instrumentation: Some electronic music artists incorporate live instrumentation into their performances, such as playing drums, guitar, or other instruments. They might use these instruments to add a live element to their music, or they might use them to create new sounds and layers that they can mix in with their electronic music. \nOverall, there are many different ways that electronic music artists can perform their music live, and the specific approach they take will depend on their personal style and the equipment they have available."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Great question!

{"question":"Why is suicide/ assisted suicide illegal ? Why is it that someone terminal , or even just in immense pain can not ask to end their life with ease ? What is the justification behind not allowing it ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["In almost everywhere in the US ( if not everywhere ) , suicide / attempted suicide is not illegal . Obviously you can be detained and then committed to an institution but it 's not because its illegal but it 's under some other law that authorizes such actions if there is a reasonable belief someone is a danger to themselves or others . Granted a lot of the repercussions of this are similar to being arrested for illegal acts , being detained , held against your will in a facility , losing some rights etc . , but there 's also some differences such as not having a criminal record . Assisted suicide is illegal though , and that 's partially because the state does n't want to be involved in trying to determine if someone is guilty of murder or if they were just assisting suicide , and the other part being it 's stance against suicide anyhow . Even in states that have death with dignity acts , they 're not exactly assisted suicide . The terminally ill patients meet with multiple doctors over a period of time and the doctor will give the patient a drug that they take on their own , so the doctor is n't directly involved with the death .","If its for someone who is terminally ill and in immense pain I think it can be justified , but the bigger question that comes in to play is ' where do you draw the line ? ' - is it certain illnesses or time frames on how long someone has to live . Mental illness is also a major player , if someone is suffering major depression suicide can seem like a logical answer . However when people are in these suicidal states its often described as being almost drunk with the intention . For the ones that recover its often a blurred memory of what happened . On another angle even though you can say it 's their choice and blah blah , it fucking destroys families and leaves behind giant skeletons in the closets of the people that were the closest to them .","This is not really something that can be explained like you 're five . This is n't something that can be explained at all . This is a long philosophical debate with no correct answer , and it depends on where * you * want to draw the line and what sort of morals * you * hold . But I guess the tl;Dr of it would be because those who consider suicide are often not in a healthy mental state to make logical and critical decisions . Suicidal individuals are often depressed . They can only see one side of things : the negative side . For example , if a suicidal individual sends you a text and you , for one reason or another , do n't reply , they wo n't take it the same way as a mentally healthy person . We might think \" well he might just be busy or he just does n't want to reply now , \" that is if we think about it at all . A suicidal individual , on the other hand , would probably think \" he does n't want to reply to me . He does n't like me . Nobody likes me . I 'm alone . \" Of course this is just an example , but it gives the general idea , I believe . I went on the verge of feeling suicidal during a phase of depression and I 've considered ending it all a few times . I even had the lyrics of my favorite song scribbled down on a piece of paper and I left it in my wallet just in case I do anything , so it can be taken as a suicide note . It 's a rather weird song . It can easily be interpreted as a celebration of life to give the listener hope , but it can just as easily be depressing and seem like a desperate cry for help . Anyway I 'm digressing .

{"question":"How does adding volumes work ? I know this might seem like a silly question , but for example when 10 people are talking at 20 dB , what happens to the resulting dB heard by somebody in the room ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["There are some simple rules for calculating with db . The easiest one to remember is that multiplying something by a numbers adds something to the db value . Multiplying with 10 adds exactly 10 db . So you would hear all the people talking at 30 db . Another rule that is handy to now is that multiplying by 2 adds about 3 db . That means 2 people would make 23 db noise , 4 people 26 db and 8 people 29 db . In addition to that you can split larger numbers up for example multiplying by 80 ( for example 80 talking people ) would be 8 * 10 which is 2 * 2 * 2 * 10 and with the mentioned rules you get 3 + 3 + 3 + 10 = 19db more . But that 's just a theoretical value that would work if all the sound happens at the same place . People are usually not just standing inside each other that 's why you 'd end up with slightly different numbers if your standing in the middle of the 10 people or right next besides them . But it works just fine for most applications .","A decibel is actually a * logarithmic * unit , meaning that each ten steps up the scale is actually a ten times increase in intensity . 20dB represents a relative intensity of 100 so if you added ten of those together it could reach 1000 intensity which is 30dB But really , there 's a bit more going on than that with stuff like sound waves cancelling eachother out , so it 'll probably end up somewhere between 20 and 30 decibels","If you have N violins playing the same note , they wo n't all be playing in sync : each of theirs sounds forms a wave but the peaks and troughs of the waves do n't necessary match up with eachother even if their frequency is exactly the same . This means that the N violins are N times as loud as N individual violins . Instead they will be sqrt(N ) louder ( and then take into account that the decibels are logarithmic ) . Here 's a website on this : URL_0 Edit : I guess the ELI5 here is that if you put two violins together playing the same note , then you would add 3dB to the decibel level of a single violin .

For example , every player has different stats ( some good at shooting three - pointers , some good at long passes , etc . ) . On the easy setting maybe each AI player is not aware of the other players stats and it chooses to pass the ball randomly instead of considering their teammates proficiencies . On a higher difficulty each AI player might have full access to the other AI players ' stats and so it will only pass the ball to the person who can shoot the best from that distance . Additionally the game could just skew the AI stats based on the difficulty . Maybe on easy it drops everyone 's ability to shoot / pass / whatever by an amount , on medium it uses their actual stats , and on hard it increases their stats by an amount so everyone on the team can shoot / pass / whatever really well . In a lot of AI structures the main way to alter behavior like this is to add randomness . You normally have them make a decision based on the data present ( i.e. pass to the guy with the best shooting ability ) but then you set a threshold for randomness , so say 5 % of the time instead of passing to the best player you pass to a random player . To make the game more easy / difficult you could alter the chance of them taking random actions instead of optimal actions .

Each signal causes a specific part of the diaphragm to vibrate in a certain way, and when all of these vibrations are combined, they create the overall movement of the diaphragm. \nThink of it like a group of people all clapping together to make a beat.

There is also to my knowledge no mountains that are close to the equator in America","There are a lot of things you want out of a launch site . The first is that you want it in your own country . Many rocket payloads are sensitive to national security and you do n't want to ship them to another country to launch them . Next you need a big area where debris can rain down in the event of either a launch failure or just stage separation . Thus far there are no launch vehicles that can get a payload to orbit with a single stage from launch , so there 's going to be * something * dropping from every launch . Oceans work very well for this , as does Siberia . Oceans and mountains are often far apart . After that you tend to want to be close to the equator , at least for most launches . If you 're going into a \" normal \" orbit then launch eastward to make use of the rotational velocity of the earth . This can be as much as 1000 mph that you do n't have to achieve on your own , which is a big deal . Some launches require going pretty much directly north or south ( e.g. Sun Synchronous or Polar orbits ) , for which Vandenburg AFB in California is useful . When you put all of these requirements together you 're left with some pretty obvious choices for launch locations . The southern - most areas in the US that are near vast uninhabited areas ( i.e. oceans ) are the Southern tip of Texas , California , and Florida . Florida is more conveniently located ( plenty of industry nearby ) so it got the bid for most of NASA 's launches . California is only good if you 're not launching East , so it 's used for some launches . Now SpaceX has started construction on a facility in the southern tip of Texas to have their own facility . * * * * * * * With all of that said , yes , you would like a higher launch site , all else being equal . It gets you above a lot of the atmosphere which can be a real drag ; pun most definitely intended . However , all else is not equal and the other concerns are more substantial . It 's worth pointing out that getting to orbit is n't about getting to a high altitude — orbit is only about 250 miles up ( altitude of the ISS ) . It 's about getting to a high speed . The space shuttle can get to the altitude of the top of Mt Everest in about 52 seconds , and that 's not even traveling straight up .

Newer iPhones use it to allow more seamless switching between wi - fi and cellular data , but that 's the only use of it that I know of .","It 's sort of possible , but you need specific hardware to achieve it . Your computer probably only has one wireless receiver built into it , which can only connect to one wireless network at any one time . Incidentally , if you 're not familiar with how networks work , here 's a super brief explanation . Networks operate by sending and receiving packets of information . Routers are in charge of taking those packets and forwarding them to the correct destination . When you watch a YouTube video you are receiving packets of information from a content provider 's servers . Data packets are sent from there through multiple routers ( including your home router ) , eventually hitting your computer . In order to link together multiple Internet connections you 'd need to set up something like ... Multi - WAN or multi - homing , which allows you to \" bond \" multiple lines into what is effectively one line with increased bandwidth . However , there are several caveats : * Without support from your ISP ( which would n't happen in your case since you have at the very least multiple accounts in use through one ISP and at worst multiple ISPs ) , you will not see tripled speeds on downloads , only what one connection supplies . However , you can run three downloads , and each will run at the maximum speed one WAN connection can handle at the same time . The router can route new requests over whichever of the two lines has the most available bandwidth if you set up the load - balancer correctly . * Most residential routers do not support multi - homing ( at least with stock firmware ) . If you have a router which supports DD - WRT , I believe it is possible , but still very tricky to configure correctly . I 'm not sure if a residential router can support it even with DD - WRT , given that they generally only have 1 WAN port and the rest are switched internally . * Sticky connections are necessary for much of today 's web , and might be difficult to set up depending on what software you 're running on your router . I honestly do n't know of a device that can do this with * * wireless * * WAN links , although it can be done via wired connections .

Closed headphones cancel noise a lot better , you 'll be able to listen in noisy / busy environments without problems .

This tends to make the sound more \" airy \" and \" expansive \" - some would say improving the \" soundstage \" . If you are unfamiliar with the concept of \" soundstage \" , this is a term loosely describing the headphone 's ability to recreate the sound in 3 - dimensional space ( think of it kind of like the difference between having 2.1 speakers and surround sound ) . Since the noise does n't reverberate in the headset on open back models , the bass response tends to be weaker than closed back headphones , but this can also improve the clarity of the sound . Because you are open to the environment , noise leaks to and from the headset as well : if you are not in a quiet environment the background noise will leak a lot into what you are listening to , and people nearby would be able to hear it quite clearly . Closed back headsets are the opposite to the above . Your ears are isolated from the environment . The sound tends to be \" fuller \" and \" more powerful \" - the soundstage is typically worse ( sounds more \" in your head \" compared to open - back headphones ) , though this can vary a lot still depending on a bunch of factors . Noise reverberates in the headset , tending to make the bass frequencies sound more powerful , though this can also obscure some of the finer details ( sometimes described as having a \" muddy \" bass for instance ) . You are isolated from the environment , and background noise will be greatly muffled and obscured , hearing only the noise the headphones are playing . The usages for each vary , but it 's basically personal preference . Each type just provides a different listening experience and it 's subjective what people will prefer . The main drawback of open - back headphones is the noise leakage , meaning they typically are n't suitable for everyday use ( you would n't be able to use them on a bus or train for instance ) . A niche application for open - back headphones that comes to mind is competitive gaming - competitive gamers value the excellent soundstage which gives great directional cues ( for instance , picking the direction of footsteps in a shooter game ) and the more balanced sound signature can prevent the game 's sound effects from becoming overwhelming ( stop loud , bassy sound effects like explosions from interfering too much with audio cues - conversely some may prefer closed back headphones for the opposite reason in that it makes sound effects like this sound more weighty and immersive )"],"chatgpt_answers":["Open-back headphones have a design where the ear cups are not sealed and allow sound to pass through them.

Cross out the 5 , write a 4 in its place , and write ' 5 ' below the 7 ( 12 - 7 ) . And so on . But that 's not how we subtract naturally . We think \" well 52 is close to 50 and 17 is close to 20 . 50 - 20 is easy : 30 . Then add the two you ignored from 52 : 32 , and the 3 you ignored going from 17 to 20 : 35 . \" Each of us may choose arbitrary places to put those values ( \" 52 is close to 50 ' 17 is close to 15 \" ) but the process is the same . We break hard problems down into easy problems and then add back the bits we skipped . That 's part of how the common core teaches math . The old way works , but students came out the other end not knowing why . It produced generations of students who did math purely by cargo cult thinking .","Common core addition is known as the cashier 's method , because cashier 's used to use it to quickly compute correct change in their heads . Essentially , you round numbers to the 10 's & 100 's to add quickly add them . For example , 42 +13 . Change that to 40 +10=50 & 2 + 3=5 then 50 + 5=55 . For a bigger number , 239 + 829 would be 200 + 800=1000 & 40 + 30=70 so you get 1000 + 70= 1070 minus the two you added = 1068 . You 've probably heard a lot of objections to common core , like it 's too complicated or it takes too long or it 's telling teachers how to teach . In reality , these are all false arguments . Parents do n't like it because they do n't intuitively understand it , but that does n't make it wrong or harder . Anything takes a long time when you 're first learning .

A fraction is a way of representing a part of a whole. For example, if you have a pie and you cut it into three equal pieces, each piece is 1/3 of the pie. That means that 1/3 is equal to one of those three pieces of pie. \nNow, let's talk about decimals. A decimal is another way of representing a part of a whole. Instead of using fractions, we use numbers that are less than one, like 0.1 or 0.5. For example, if you have $1 and you want to represent one-third of that as a decimal, you would divide 1 by 3 to get 0.33333333 (and so on). \nNow, let's talk about how we can turn a fraction into a decimal. To do this, we can divide the number on the top (also called the numerator) by the number on the bottom (also called the denominator). For example, let's say we have the fraction 3/3. If we divide 3 by 3, we get 1. That means that 3/3 is equal to 1. \nNow, let's say we have the fraction 3/3 as a decimal. If we divide 3 by 3, we get 0.999999 (and so on). But that's not quite right, because we want to represent 3/3 as a whole number. To do that, we need to put a decimal point and a zero after the one, like this: 1.0000. That means that 3/3 as a decimal is equal to 1.0000, or just 1. \nSo to sum it up: 3/3 is equal to 1, and 3/3 as a decimal is equal to 1.0000.

Additionally, the Lightning connector is reversible, which means it can be plugged in either way, making it easier to use. \nAnother reason is that the Lightning connector is able to transmit data as well as power, which means that it can be used to connect devices to a computer for transferring files, or to connect to other devices for things like audio or video output. The micro-USB connector is primarily designed for charging and does not have this capability. \nOverall, the decision to use the Lightning connector was made by Apple in order to give them more control over the design and functionality of their devices, and to offer features that are not possible with micro-USB."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Hey there!

Even when you lose fat , you keep the same number of fat cells . When you gain weight in the form of fat , what 's happening is that your body is storing energy ( in the form of triglyceride or triglycerol , ca n't remember which ) inside your fat cells . When fat is \" liberated \" from your fat cells , a process called lipolysis will turn that triglyceride into glycerol and three free fat acids ( FFAs ) . The FFAs enter the blood stream and make their way to the muscles . The muscles say , \" ermagerd , gimme \" and hand the FFAs off to their mitochondria . A chemical process occurs that splits up the FFAs super long chains of carbon atoms , turning it into something called Acetyl - CoA.

First, rubber is not as strong as metal, so it might not be able to support the weight of the train as well.

A rectangular sensor can capture a wider field of view than a square sensor of the same size, so it is able to capture more of the scene in a single photograph. \nWhen you look through the viewfinder of an SLR camera, you are looking through the lens itself, which is why the image appears round.

Many people think embryonic stem cells from abortions , which is incorrect . In fact they come in - vitro fertilisation ( i.e. artificially injecting donated eggs with sperm ) . When couples go for IVF , because they can not conceive naturally scientists fertilise several eggs ( usually around 20 ) in a dish . Obviously nobody wants to be implanted with 20 fertilised eggs , so there are spares left over . They would either go in the bin , or they can be used for research . That 's where scientists get their stem cells from . Embryonic stem cells are only present during very early stages after the sperm fertilises the egg . This is called the blastocyst . If this was taking place inside a woman , she would NOT be pregnant at this stage . A woman is only pregnant after the fertilised egg implants into the uterus wall . Thus , embryonic stem cells are not in any way related to abortions . 2 ) Technically , a fertilised egg * could * be considered as the start of life . The egg carries one set of chromosomes ( 23 ) , and the sperm carries the other ( 23 ) . So when fertilisation takes place and the chromosomes combine ( giving you 2x 23 chromosomes ) and the cell divides , this technically is a brand new combination - an individual - i.e. all of the genetic instructions required create a unique human being .

This made it a more cost-effective choice for manufacturers. \nWhite computers were not as common in the 1980s and 1990s because white plastic was more difficult to mold and not as readily available as beige. It was also more prone to yellowing over time, which could make the computer look old and outdated. However, white computers have become more popular in recent years, and you can now find white laptops, desktops, and other devices."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well little one, in the old days, when computers were first being made, there weren't as many fancy colors available.

{"question":"Why did we choose 360 degrees to represent a circle ? A circle can be infinitely divided . Why not 100 ? 1000 ? 400 even -- 100 degrees per quadrant . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["URL_0 Lots of math is very , very old . Our numbering system uses a base of 10 , but that 's not the only option , computers use base 2 ( binary ) and sometimes base 16 ( hexadecimal ) for example . Numbering systems can use any base at all , but the important thing is to be consistent . wayyyyyyyyyy back the Babylonians used base 60 . They divided each circle into 6 , 6 * 60=360 . As with any modern language there are sometimes odd hold overs from times past . In this case the world moved on to a base 10 system , but the whole 360 degrees in a circle was just never changed . Changing it now would be a pain in the ass , but most more advanced math is done using radians anyway , so it does not really matter .","360 can be evenly divided by more numbers . 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 ... shoot , every number from 1 to 12 except 7 and 11 . That 's pretty convenient .","While the true reason is n't known for sure , the wiki states a few theories . It could have been to match the number of days in a year in the Persian calendar . Or it could have been from Babaloynians who used the number 60 frequently in their system , representing circle measurements with six equilateral triangles , each of which was broken down into sixty subdivisions , thus totalling 360 . In any case , its continued popularity in ancient times may be in part due to how easily divisible it is by most small numbers ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The 360 degree system for measuring angles is based on the idea that a circle can be divided into 360 equal parts. Each of these parts is called a degree, and they are used to measure angles. \nOne reason that 360 degrees was chosen as the number of parts to divide a circle into is that it is a highly composite number, which means that it can be evenly divided by many smaller numbers. For example, 360 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, and 360. This makes it easier to do calculations involving angles, because the degree measurements can be divided and multiplied by these smaller numbers. \nAnother reason for using 360 degrees to measure angles is that it allows for a lot of precision. Dividing a circle into 100 parts, for example, would not allow for as much precision in measuring angles as dividing it into 360 parts would. Similarly, dividing a circle into 400 or 1000 parts would not be as useful, because these numbers are not as easily divisible by smaller numbers. \nOverall, the choice to use 360 degrees to measure angles is a practical one that has stood the test of time.

Emerging unscathed from the radiation , humanity is now enslaved by the machine and its ability to control our movement , access to others , and food sources . We can not fight it because it is everywhere and nowhere at once . Anyone who digresses is summarily executed . Gradually , the machine comes to see our worth and incorporates organic matter into itself . After a few generations , it creates a way to use humans as an energy source .

The researchers reboot the machine and try again . tl;dr : The matrix is the worst possible I can imagine . The real thing is boring ...","Well , if we 're going to leave behind Hollywood in our explanation ( Terminator just is n't going to happen , sorry . AIs will never be in control of large scale systems without a human in the loop ) , the real danger is that we get to the point where the evolution of artificial intelligence is faster than the evolution of our meaty knowledge . We can lose control of the ends to which these tools are being made . Think of it this way : before there was speech , all we could do to learn was to watch others . Before there was writing , humans essentially had to re - learn everything by ( at best ) being taught by someone else . Before there was computers , we were limited to the speed of data lookup ( how fast you could retrieve the information ) . Before there was the Internet , we were limited by data volume ( how much data your library or computer stored ) . As we made incremental progress , we accelerated our pace of learning , until now we use computers and AI as a sort of \" almost thinking \" tool : we train computers to infer what we will be interested in seeing . In fact , we use computers to design new processors , so you can sort of see how our tools are becoming necessary to make more of their kind . No one person knows where all the transistors are on a CPU anymore , rather we 're using software to ensure that the thing that runs the next generation of software will do a good job . At some point , it 's not inconceivable that this role of computers can pass a point known as \" the singularity \" : imagine someone is designing an AI , but the design of the algorithm gets too complicated to understand . If we get to the point that advanced algorithms are being used to create AI that designs algorithms , and on down the chain , it 's possible that our AI development will proceed _ without us _ . Now , we still have control of this process , but there are some dangers : what if the AIs we develop get too complicated for us to understand ? Then they become , best case scenario , inaccessible or worthless to us . This is likely to happen very soon , actually : multi - layer perceptrons ( [ neural networks ] ( URL_0 ) ) are _ specifically designed _ so that they are not understandable by humans in the goal of being more accurate at predicting the desired output . They are part of a class of supervised learning algorithms termed \" black box \" : you train them up , give them an input , and just have to trust the output , because you ca n't really understand what 's happening in the middle . In the worst case scenario , poorly designed algorithms find ways to prevent us from exerting control . While we will still likely be able to starve them for some time ( cut the cord ) , the deeper we get with AI algorithms , the more powerful they get - but the harder they get to understand . Perhaps , if the figure of merit in their design is \" do stuff as efficiently as possible \" , human - in - the - loop interactions can be so inefficient as to carry less weight than the algorithm itself does , which would cut us out of the decision making . Of course , well designed algorithms would optimize more for \" do stuff as efficiently as possible , with human tuning , and the ability to quit if something goes wrong \" . Since humans decide what the \" goal \" of a well - constructed AI is ( and will for some time to come ) , computers lack their own volition . They are n't going to \" decide \" that they are smarter than us . This means we still understand at least what the AIs we develop are attempting to optimize for . When we let them optimize themselves , it 's not inconceivable , however unlikely , that they choose to optimize for something we do n't think is important . This is n't really going to lead to war against the machines , but rather some economic disaster : when we rely on an AI for decision making ( like is very common in today 's stock market ) , one slip of the algorithm can [ cause a lot of economic havok ] ( URL_1 ) . tl;dr : the more layers of AI we use to design and build AI , the harder it is to ensure that the result is exactly what we were asking for .","There 's quite a large literature on super - intelligent AI , dangers and coping strategies .

{"question":"How are capital cities chosen for a state / province / country ? I was just curious as to how capital cities are generally chosen . Are they voted for , or does the government decide ? Can they change ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["I can only speak to the US . Originally , the capital of the US was New York City . This angered the agrarian types since New York was the business center of the country . Thomas Jefferson in particular did n't like New York as the capital . So one day Alexander Hamilton , the secretary of the treasury approached George Washington about paying off the country 's debts from the Revolutionary War . Washington told him to talk to Jefferson , the secretary of state . Jefferson proffered that he 'd help Hamilton if Hamilton agreed to move the capital to somewhere near Virginia . Hamilton agreed and now the capital is Washington , DC .","Generally the legislature decides , and when they do , it 's generally based on geography . And yes , the absolutely can change , it 's just not as common nowadays . For example , I 'll take you through the history of Georgia 's capitals ( since I live here ) . Savannah , on the coast , was the first city established in Georgia , and it was the de facto \" capital \" during the time when we were still a colony ( since we were technically governed by England , but the royal governor sat in Savannah ) . When we became a state , Savannah was named the state capital mostly because it always had been . As the state expanded , the population started shifting west and so Augusta , a little further up and west , was chosen as the next capital partially because it was nearer to the new center of the population and partially because it had served as a rotating capital with Savannah whenever the British were constantly laying siege to it during the Revolution . Augusta was the capital for a little bit before they moved it to Louisville , which did n't amount to much . In 1802 , governor John Milledge sent out a party to find the new geographic center of the state and there they would establish the new capital . The surveyors found a natural spring bubbling up close enough to the center , and so decided to establish Milledgeville as the new capital ( and eventually my home town :D ) . Milledgeville served as capital through the Civil War , until 1868 . During Reconstruction , the military governor of Georgia ordered new delegates to meet in Atlanta . Atlanta became the official capital for a few reasons . First , it was a rebirth from being burned down by General Sherman ( even open - minded , progressive liberals in Georgia gag at the mention of his name ) , and it gave Georgia a new start away from its Confederate capital . Also , Milledgeville is surrounded by hills , which made it hard as hell for trains to get in . Atlanta , on the other hand , is relatively flat and actually began life as a train hub called Terminus . It also was a bigger , more modern city on the rise . So the decision was pretty easy to make , and Atlanta 's served as capital of the state ever since . TL;DR : It 's the legislature deciding where to put the capital , and they can change relatively simply . They just do n't tend to anymore .","There 's a whole load of explanations for why a city ends up being the capital of a country . It 's not necessarily because it was explicitly chosen . For example the Roman empire started out as a the city state of Rome . So naturally Rome was the capital of the empire . And when Italy finally unified again in the 19th Century , it made sense to make Rome the capital again .

For example, if a bag of chips didn't have enough air in it, the chips might get crushed and become stale. On the other hand, if there was too much air in the bag, the chips might get broken or fall out of the bag. \nFinally, some of the empty space in a package is there because of the way the food is produced and packaged. For example, it might be easier or more efficient for the manufacturer to package the food in a certain way, even if it means there is some unused space in the package. \nOverall, the amount of unused space in a package of food is a balance between making sure the food stays fresh and protecting it from damage, and making sure the package is practical and efficient to produce."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, kiddo, the big companies who make those packaged foods think carefully about how much they should put in the bag.

The most common in my area ( Southern California ) are pressure sensors in the road .

I have heard of camera - type sensors as well , including infrared cameras and motion sensors , and magnetic - type sensors , which detect large amounts of metal .","Some are timed , and either have differing timing depending on time of day , or just use the same timing regardless . Others are the sensor kind .

Stop lights are used to control the flow of traffic at intersections. When you approach a stop light, you'll see a red light, a yellow light, and a green light. The red light means that you need to stop and wait for the light to change. The yellow light means that the light is about to turn red, so you should stop if you can do so safely. The green light means that you can go through the intersection, but you should still be cautious and make sure it's safe to proceed. \nNow, how does the stop light know when to change? At non-peak times, stop lights use sensors to detect when there are cars waiting at the intersection. When a car is waiting at the intersection, the stop light will stay red for that direction until the sensor no longer detects a car. This helps to keep traffic moving smoothly and efficiently. \nAt peak times, when there is more traffic, the stop light may be programmed to follow a set schedule. For example, the light may stay green for one direction for a certain amount of time, then turn red and stay red for a certain amount of time, then turn green for the other direction. This helps to keep traffic flowing and prevent backups. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Great question! Stop lights work by using sensors called loop detectors underground that measure the presence of cars at each intersection. A specific amount of cars need to be detected in each direction before the signal will change.

During non-peak times, these algorithms prioritize major roadways by limiting green light time in less busy areas. During rush hours, timers are also used to optimize the signal timings."}

Natural thing to do for party so supportive of nationalistic symbols and tradition . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The German Emperors were n't really a long - established tradition like other monarchies . They were the Kings of Prussia , the last three of whom adopted the title of German Emperor . Also it 's likely that Hitler partly blamed Wilhelm II for Germany 's defeat in the First World War , so bringing in his grandson to restore the monarchy would n't appeal .","There was a rather long discussion about the relationship of nationalism , monarchy and the whole question of whether the Nazis where left or right - wing recently on /r / badhistory . For some deeper stuff , I therefore recommend this [ post of mine ] ( URL_0 ) . The easy version , for ELI5 : Yes , the Nazis were , by modern definition , right wing , ultra - nationalist , traditionalist ; although they personally pretended to reject this left to right spectrum . What we have to consider is that European , and especially German parliaments and parties have always been very different from the classic American two party system . Meaning that parties with every so slightly differing opinions might easily split up , while it would , for example , be crazy for the Tea party in the US to try to form an independent party from the Republicans . Now , the difference between the Nazis and the National conservatives ( who were monarchists ) was n't actually that small though . That 's what so special both about fascism and communism . Both were essentially an alternative interpretation of the left and right wing at this time . The right wing up until then meant being supportive of the recently disposed monarchy . And the Nazis did actually embrace that narrative of the monarchy , or at least the empire , more than most people grant them here in this thread . In the post I linked , there 's a fairly well known postcard from that time showing Frederick II . \" The Great \" ; Bismarck , chancellor of Prussia and the Empire ; Hindenburg , Chief of Staff at the end of World War II and finally , Hitler . The well known pompous marches , evocative of the Romans ; and the whole term of the \" Third Reich \" show that connection as well . The problem was , that , as others have pointed out , Germans made the Kaiser , Wilhelm II . , responsible for losing World War II - besides Jews and Socialists , due to Nazi propaganda . They also despised the Elitist nature that was even inherent to the late Imperial army , with Nobles taking all the important positions of power and the common men dying in the trenches . They still liked the idea of a powerful Empire though ; and thought that more conservative mores were needed , making greater social freedom responsible for the fall of the republic . ( The same narrative we see with modern right wingers : Multiculturalism and tolerance towards alternative lifestyles weaken the nation . ) Essentially , Hitler made conservatism for the masses . The Nazis never really abandoned their silent admiration for the monarchy though - see the pompous marches and the whole \" Reich\"-narrative . The dethroned Kaiser actually resided in Belgium for the rest of his life and thought that Hitler would eventually reinstate him . When he died , Hitler gave him a pompous funeral ; with Swastikas all around , despite for the Kaiser previously having said that he did not want them to be displayed there . The army was also still heavily influenced by former nobles . VON Stauffenberg and his accomplices , who tried and failed to kill Hitler , were all disgruntled monarchists , but had collaborated with the Nazis so far because there evidently was still a lot of ideological overlap .","The were National Socialists ( Nazi is short for this ) - not National Roaylists ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The Nazi Party, which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945, was indeed an ultranationalist party that sought to promote the interests of the German nation and people.

This is because you are earning interest on the original investment as well as on the interest you received. This is known as compound interest. \nThe number e is related to compound interest because it represents the rate at which an investment would grow if the interest were compounded continuously, rather than just once per year. This means that the interest is being reinvested and earning more interest constantly, rather than just once per year. \nThe formula for calculating compound interest using e is: \nA = P * e^(rt) \nWhere: \nA is the amount of money you will have after a certain number of years.\nP is the amount of money you are investing.\nr is the annual interest rate.\nt is the number of years you are investing the money. \nSo, for example, if you invested $100 at an annual interest rate of 10% for one year, using the formula above, you would calculate the final amount of money you would have like this: \nA = 100 * e^(0.1*1)\n= 100 * 2.71828\n= $271.83 \nI hope this helps to give you a basic understanding of the number e and how it is related to compound interest.

This means that even if the cost of oranges is relatively low, the cost of the juice can still be relatively high because of the large quantity of oranges needed. \nSecond, producing and packaging orange juice is a complex process that involves many steps and costs. The oranges must be harvested, transported to a processing facility, cleaned, juiced, pasteurized, and bottled or packaged. Each of these steps requires labor and resources, which add to the overall cost of the juice. \nFinally, the cost of orange juice may also be affected by factors such as demand, supply, and transportation costs.

But the main market is and will be Japan . Legend of Korra , ( american cartoon ) , simply : not high enough profit = cancel","One difference between Western animation and Japanese anime is the attitude towards filler . In anime , since the show is usually based on a manga , it 's considered all right for some episodes to not have very much to do with the story . In Dragon Ball Z , for instance , the manga and anime ran at the same time , and when the anime got to the end of the latest manga , material had to be made up . This is what brought us things like Goku and Piccolo racing cars , or episode - long screaming matches that included flashbacks ( exaggeration ) . This kind of thing can be considered a bonus for folks who already read the manga . In the West , filler is considered as just a cost - saving strategy . Western shows are more commonly the establishers of their story , so there 's less of a reason for side material . This means a Western show will usually have fewer episodes per season .

{"question":"Why does every animal have two ( 2 ) eyes ? I know spiders have 8 . But with such diversity in the world , should n't a few species have 4 , 6 , or even just one ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["There are five reasons why animals have two eyes ( rather than one ): 1 . Better depth perception . The image on the two eyes is slightly different and by comparing the locations of the images , an animal can locate objects in depth . It is not the only depth cue but it is an important one for predator or tree dwelling species . 2 . Wider field of view . The animal can see more of the visual world with two eyes than with one . 3 . Each eye has a blind spot , and each eye covers the blind spot of the other . There is a blindspot in each eye where the optic nerve leaves the eye , and in that region of the eye , there are no photoreceptors so you are blind there . However , the other eye covers that region so you still know what is there . 4 . Easier to see dim lights with two eyes than one . Two eyes both catching light particles will have a lower threshold for detecting dim lights than just one eye . 5 . Most importantly : as a spare ! An animal still has a good chance of surviving with one eye , but very little chance of reproducing with none . Now , why do n't we have MORE than two eyes ? Likely because , in mammals , the number of new nerve cells that would have to be supported by an additional eye would not be worth the benefits of having it . Nerve cells are the hungriest cells in the body , and more of the cerebral cortex is devoted to vision than any other function . Having additional eyes ( beyond two ) in mammals would require huge numbers of new nerve cells to support them , and the metabolic cost would not be worth the benefit .","Each eye creates a slightly different image because they are in different places . The overlay of these two images creates the illusion of depth and allows us to know how far things are away from us . This is called stereoscopic vision . In other animals , like deer , the eyes are on the sides of the head . This restricts the use of stereoscopic vision but gives the animals greater peripheral vision , allowing them to see predators . This is sufficient for animals to see depth and any more eyes would not be worth the energy use and risk that they require . Eyes are easily damaged which can lead to infection and they are complex and thus require a large amount of energy to create and maintain from a purely mechanical standpoint . If this mutation ever developed there was no evolutionary advantage for those creatures that manifested a third eye ( or the early mutation : a light sensitive bump ) and so they were not able to breed and pass on this mutation in significant enough numbers to change the population . Spiders and Insects have multiple and/or compound eyes because they evolved under different circumstances .","The problem with one eye is that it does n't allow you to see 3D properly ( there are other indicators than stereovision , but it 's a big one ) . More than two are not necessary for it , so it would be a waste to have them ; nature does n't waste ."],"chatgpt_answers":["It's a good question! Having two eyes is actually quite useful for many animals, including humans. Having two eyes allows animals to see in 3D, which can be helpful for judging distances and navigating their environment. It also allows animals to see more of their surroundings at once, which can be helpful for finding food, avoiding predators, and other important tasks. \nSpiders are an interesting example, because they do have eight eyes. However, not all spiders have the same number of eyes. Some have six, some have four, and some even have fewer. The number of eyes that a spider has is partly determined by its species, but it can also be influenced by other factors such as the spider's size and the environment it lives in. \nOverall, the number of eyes that an animal has is a result of evolution. Over time, certain traits that helped animals survive and reproduce became more common in a population, while other traits became less common. This process is called natural selection. In the case of eyes, having two eyes has proven to be a useful trait for many animals, so it has become more common in a variety of species. However, there are still some animals that have a different number of eyes, and this can be due to the specific evolutionary pressures that they have faced."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Wow, great question!

{"question":"These gifs . What is a hypercube ? How can planes be 3D ? What in the heck is going on ? Here are the gifs : URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["A square is equal on all two of its dimensions , a cube is equal on all of its 3 dimensions , and a hypercube is equal in all of its 4 dimensions","* * TL;DR : A Hypercube is a cube in 4 dimensions , as opposed to a normal cube that only has 3 dimensions . What we see is the ' shadow ' of the hypercube pass trough our own dimension * * Let 's start by defining the dimensions . I assume you know what 3D is . 3D a geometrical concept where locations are measured in 3 numbers . { x , y , z } . You live in a 3d world . Everything you see is in 3D. Now , I also assume that you 're familiar with 2D. Things in 2D can be described with 2 numbers . { x , y } . A pixel on your screen for instance has an x and y position . The points on your high school graph / plot has x location and y location . 1D is the same concept . Just a line . You can mark a location on a line with 1 number , the length from one end of the line and to that location . But if there is 3D , and 2D , and 1D , there can also be 4D , and 5D , and 6D. There can be an infinte - D if you care to count . The rules of all those dimensions are the same . For a dimension N you must use N numbers to describe a location in it . so , the fourth dimension has a 4 point system . { x , y , z , w}(I think it was W , do n't kill me for it ) . A hypercube is a cube , but in 4D. Imagine it like this : A 3D cube is a cube , but a 2D ' cube ' is just a rectangle . A 2D circle is a sphere in 3D. Each shape that has a definition also has a definition in other dimension , they just change a bit to reflect and add the new dimension . A hypercube is the 4D version of the cube , the rectangle . . Now , we can not see the fourth dimension , can we ? We ca n't even imagine it . but we can understand the third dimension . a 3d Plane to 4D is just what a 2D plane is to 3D. a person in two dimensions would n't see us at all , and would n't understand a third dimension like we do n't understand a fourth one . But if a cube is to pass trough a paper that flat lander would see the cube as it passes as lines , changing and altering . It 's a bit hard to explain . Imagine That you would have a wall , cut a thin strip in it to look trough , and watch someone walk past it . You can only see a small part of him at a time , only what is currently passing the strip . you 'd first see a bit of the nose , then that bit would go away and the first bit of face appears , then that goes away and you see the eye and torso e.t.c . what is happening here is a cube passing trough our dimension , or the 2D shadow of it . The 3D ' shapes ' are just bits of the cube that are currently passing trough our slit that we can see . somewhere in the 4th dimension the rest of the cube is connected to what we see , but we just ca n't see it . as it passes and new areas of the cube passes by us the 3D shape on the screen morphs and changes to reflect how the 3D component of the 4D cube currently looks like from our perspective . . I may have gotten a bit off track , but that 's basically it . It 's a mathematical representation of what a 4D cube would look like if we would slide it trough our own dimension .","First , let 's go through a mental exercise . We start with a point .

It has two terminating points . Extend a line along another dimension . You get a plane with length and width , with four terminating points . Extend a plane along another dimension .

{"question":"how do we diferentiate the frequency of a note from the sound that characterize a certain instirment ? Why can I tell an A on a cello apart from an A on a piano ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Timbre . An A on either is not a single frequency , it is a \" fundamental \" and a bunch of multiples of that frequency , called \" overtones \" . Together they make up the timbre of that instrument . Different instruments have different overtones . Of course , they may also have other characteristics , such as the rate of attack ( how the volume grows from zero to full amplitude ) and decay ( the opposite ) .","Two main things differentiate different sounds that have the same frequency . One is the \" shape \" of the sound . In nature , the shape of the frequency is likely to be a sine - wave . On a graph it would be a snake - like shape . Electronically generated sounds can have different shapes , like a square - wave , sawtooth - wave , or whatever . Second is the overtones . Suppose the frequency is middle C , at 262 beats per second . One instrument might have a strong overtone at the next C up , with a frequency of 524 beats per second . Another instrument might have hardly any sound there , but a strong overtone at the next C above that . We hear the lowest frequency as the note , and we hear the shape and the overtone as information about the kind of instrument that created that note .","Three main things : * Timbre ( Which overtones - I 'll explain what those are soon - are most present in the sound ) * Envelope . This describes the amplitude shape of the sound - how hard is the attack , how long does the attack stay that way , how long does the sound last , and how quickly does the sound decay ? In a synthesizer , you can control all of these components through something called ADSR ( Attack - Decay - Sustain - Release ) . * Additional Noise ( The sound of the guitar amp hum , the squeak of a piano pedal , the rosin of the bow on the violin string , etc ) Now , Timbre . Notes are made of vibrations . Imagine a vibrating string . That string vibrates along its entire length , but it also vibrates along divisions of that length . The smaller the divisions , the higher the notes . This means that inside of every note you hear are several , fainter , higher notes . These are called partials , overtones , or harmonics . An instrument 's timbre is decided largely by the * balance * of those overtones . A flute , for example , has a very pure overtone expression with mostly lower , consonant ( meaning , for ELI5 purposes , \" pleasant \" ) partials . This gives it a clear sound . A distorted electric guitar , by contrast , has a lot of presence in its higher partials , which gives it more of a jagged quality . This is an over - simplified version , but all you need to know is that the overtone pattern determines much of the quality of the sound . You can actually hear the overtone series in your own voice , because each vowel brings out a different overtone . Sing a medium - low note in your range , clearly , and switch slowly between \" ooh \" and \" ee \" - you should hear , faintly , a note above the note you 're singing that suddenly gets higher and louder when you sing the \" ee \" . If you get good enough at this , you can do what [ this weird awesome lady ] ( URL_0 ) does and sing two notes at the same time . The same thing that makes two of your vowels sound different - even though they 're almost identical sounds coming from the same voice - is what makes two instruments sound different : overtones . But what happens if two instruments have similar overtone profiles ? A trumpet and an oboe , for example , have almost identical timbres . Here we want to look at our envelope , particularly our attack . A trumpet has a very crisp , biting attack that 's very fast , while an oboe has a much more mellow attack . If we jump into the middle of an oboe or trumpet note , it 's hard to hear the difference - but that initial attack & sputter in the trumpet makes the difference very clear ! The vocal equivalent of this would be consonants . Finally , noise . In addition to the overtone series and the envelope , there are all sorts of noises that go along with a sound that we may not consider as musical but are nonetheless important . The sound of additional air coming through a trumpet , the rattle in somebody 's voice when they sing a note too early in the morning , the buzz of a guitar amplifier . Our ear takes all of these clues , puts them together , and - voila ! - you 've perceived not just what the note is , but what kind of instrument is making the note !"],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure! When we listen to music, we can hear different sounds made by different instruments. Each instrument makes a sound that is unique to that instrument, and we can tell them apart based on the way they sound. \nFor example, when you play an \"A\" note on a cello, it will sound different from when you play an \"A\" note on a piano. This is because the cello and the piano are different instruments, and they produce sound in different ways. \nThe cello uses strings that are played with a bow, and the strings vibrate to create sound. The piano uses strings that are struck by hammers when you press a key, and the strings vibrate to create sound. Because the cello and the piano use different methods to produce sound, the \"A\" notes they play will sound different. \nThe pitch of a note refers to how high or low it sounds.

But there is still no reason for those of us with lower smell to be unable to reproduce .","Most of the birds . We , like birds , evolved to have good eyesight . We are also not carnivores , we are omnivores ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The human sense of smell is not necessarily \"bad\" compared to other animals, but it is not as finely tuned as the sense of smell of some other species. This is because the part of the human brain responsible for processing smells (the olfactory bulb) is not as well developed as in animals that rely more heavily on their sense of smell to find food, avoid predators, and communicate with each other. \nThere are many other carnivores (meat-eating animals) that have a much stronger sense of smell than humans. For example, dogs and bears have a highly developed sense of smell that they use to locate food, detect the presence of other animals, and communicate with each other. Some animals, such as snakes, use their sense of smell to locate prey, while others, such as lions and tigers, use it to hunt and locate other animals. \nSo, while the human sense of smell may not be as strong as some other animals, it still serves important functions, such as helping us detect and avoid rotten or spoiled food, and helping us recognize and differentiate between different odors."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Hey buddy, so our noses are not as powerful as some other animals like dogs or even sharks! But that doesn't mean that our sense of smell is bad. Most of us rely more heavily on our vision than on scent because our ancestors needed this sense less for hunting or survival. \n\nAs for carnivores that can't smell, Well, none that I'm aware of. Scent is important to carnivores to hunt their prey. even felines (like house cats!) have a powerful sense"}
{"question":"How do they shoot space movies to look like zero gravity ? I 'm talking older movies , too , like 2001 a Space Odyssey when superior editing technology was still a ways off . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["In the case of 2001 it was actually really clever : They suspended the actors on wires just like a lot of movies used to do , but they built the set sideways and put the camera on the ground pointing upwards . This accomplished two things : First , the actor 's body hid the wires so you did n't have to try to remove them in post . Second , the actor 's movements drifting horizontally ( which , from the camera 's perspective , appeared to be vertical ) looked WAY more natural than having a stagehand jerk the wires up and down .","You have a few options . You can either use wires and camera tricks to make the actor appear weightless , or you can rent a large plane and fly in series of parabolic arcs to simulate weightlessness for short intervals .","Superior editing technology you say ! Anne hathaway said in an interview they basically stood on one leg and leaned around shooting interstellar as well as some cable use :)"],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several techniques that filmmakers use to create the illusion of zero gravity in movies. One technique is called \"forced perspective.\" This involves shooting a scene with the camera at an angle that makes objects in the foreground look larger than they are, while objects in the background appear smaller. This creates the illusion that the objects in the foreground are closer to the camera and are therefore subject to less gravity. \nAnother technique is called \"high-speed photography.\" This involves shooting a scene at a very high frame rate, typically hundreds or thousands of frames per second. When the footage is played back at a normal frame rate, it appears as though the objects in the scene are moving much more slowly than they actually are. This can be used to make it look like objects are floating or moving slowly in a weightless environment. \nIn some cases, filmmakers will also use special effects and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create the illusion of zero gravity. This can involve digitally altering the movement of objects in a scene or creating entirely digital environments that look like they are in space. \nIn the past, filmmakers have also used practical effects to create the illusion of zero gravity. For example, in the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" the filmmakers used a special rig called a \"zero gravity plane\" to simulate weightlessness. The plane would fly in a parabolic pattern, allowing the actors to experience brief periods of weightlessness. The filmmakers then shot the scenes during these periods and used editing techniques to make it look like the actors were in a weightless environment."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well kid, it's a nice trick they used to do! They first built a special airplane that would fly really high, almost to where there is no more air pressure. They would go up and then down really fast over and over again.

The camera captures those moments and then the footage is inserted into regular film scenes to make it look like we're really floating around in"}
{"question":"if the taxpayers pay for sports arenas in the US , why do they still pay for tickets and pay to watch on TV ? Also how can the NFL network exist ? Should n't the games be played on TV for free ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Do you enjoy having those arenas in your town ?

Just because taxes pay for something does n't make it free to taxpayers ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sports arenas in the US are often funded by taxpayers, but that does not mean that people do not have to pay to watch games or events in those arenas or on TV. The cost of building and maintaining sports arenas is typically paid for through a combination of public funds and private investment. While taxpayers may contribute to the construction and upkeep of the arenas, they are still operated as businesses, and the teams and organizations that use the arenas generate revenue by charging people to attend games or events and through television contracts. \nThe NFL (National Football League) is a professional sports league in the US that consists of 32 teams. The NFL generates revenue through various sources, including ticket sales, merchandise sales, and television contracts. The NFL Network is a television network that is owned and operated by the NFL, and it broadcasts live NFL games and other programming related to the league. The NFL Network is able to exist because it is able to generate revenue through subscriptions and advertising. \nWhile it might seem unfair that people have to pay to watch sports games or events on TV or in person, it is important to remember that professional sports teams and leagues are businesses that need to generate revenue to cover their expenses, including player salaries, arena maintenance and operations, and other costs.

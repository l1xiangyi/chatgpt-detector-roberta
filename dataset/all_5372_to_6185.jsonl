{"question":"Why is older wine considered \" better \" ? Why do people prefer wine that has been \" aged \" ? What does aging do to the wine to make it any different than normal wine ? Explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["It 's actually not better , in a general sense . Not all wines taste better with age . However , there are still wines that do . Main reason for them is what 's called \" tannins \" , which comes mostly from the oak barrels ( that 's why it 's stored in those ) . Tannins also come from grape stems , seeds , and skins . They have anti - fungal properties , but also make the unripe grape taste really nasty until the seed is mature . Not only do they taste bitter , tannins bind to the proteins that make your saliva slimy , stripping away the sliminess , leaving your mouth feeling dry , chalky , and ashen . The winemakers determine the amount of tannins that go into the wine , primarily by controlling how long the mashed grapes stay in contact with the tannin - loaded stems , skins , and seeds . Wine that ’s allowed to marinate at length in the grape detritus will start out as a bitter , dry youngster , and mature into a rich , complex , and highly desirable vintage . Wines that age well do so over a continuum , and there is an ideal period where the flavors of both youth and maturity are balanced . [ ^Know ^more . ] ( URL_0 )","Sorry for formatting , on mobile . I 'm seeing a lot of misinformation here , especially with claims that oak aging being the main factor . Yes , being in a barrel for a year or two is important , but that 's mainly a source of flavor and ' structure ' that gets better as wines age ( AFTER being bottled ) . Basically , there are 2 factors at play : cork aeration and sugar breakdown . Corks allow tiny amounts of air in , which smooths out and changes the flavors already present-- wines that are 10 + years old tend to have less of a tannin ' bite'-- , while sugars breaking down into alcohol adds more . EDIT : sugar breakdown is more of an issue with white wines . Acidity also plays a role in making sure the wine stays balanced , in that one flavor does n't dominate . As a rule of thumb , red wine tends to get softer and more complex ( so more flavors , like leather , dried flowers , meat , and other things that sound odd , but tastes great in old wine ) . If a wine has lower alcohol and high acidity , it tends to age better than most . Lots of tannin also play a big role . Burgundy pinot noir is a good example of this : wines from the 60 's are still being raved about by people who can afford them . It 's worth noting that the best ' aging ' wines tend to be really harsh/ not very flavorful early on . Bordeaux wines , especially Cabernet Sauvignon - heavy blends , need several years to be palatable . Californian wines , on the other hand , can be drank much earlier . There are several exceptions to these trends , but this is eli5 . If you 'd like anything clarified , let me know .

When wine is young, it can taste raw, harsh, and unbalanced. As wine ages, it can develop more complex flavors and aromas, and the harshness can smooth out. This process of aging wine is called \"cellaring,\" and it can occur in a variety of ways. Some people prefer wine that has been aged for a long time because they enjoy the flavors and aromas that develop during the aging process. Other people may prefer younger wine because they prefer the fresher, fruitier flavors that are more pronounced in young wine.\\n\\nThere are several factors that can affect how a wine ages. The type of grape, the climate where the grapes are grown, and the way the wine is made can all have an impact on how the wine tastes as it ages. The way a wine is stored can also affect its aging process. Wines that are stored in a cool, dark place with a consistent temperature and humidity level will generally age more slowly and evenly than wines that are stored in a warm, humid, or brightly lit place.\\n\\nIn general, red wines tend to age better than white wines because they have more tannins, which are natural compounds found in the skin, seeds, and stems of grapes. Tannins can help preserve the wine and give it a long, complex finish. White wines, on the other hand, tend to have less tannins and can lose their freshness and flavor more quickly as they age.\\n\\nSo, in summary, aging wine can change its flavors and aromas and make it taste more complex and smooth.

This savings goes directly to the company , increasing wealth of executives and decreasing wealth of the middle class . Same goes for all the other large companies in the world , increased automation increases corporate profits and permanently eliminates jobs . These companies are acting in the capitalisic manner they always have been , the difference is that technology has reached the point where human jobs are being completely eliminated instead of just being replaced with better ones . This impact of automation is why we are seeing such a large growth in the wealth gap and why we should expect this gap to continue to increase instead of slowing down .","1 . because rich people have more power , and they favor their own interests 2 . because the rest of us keep voting for people who act to grow this gap .

Generally wealthy people can not consume a significantly larger amount of transient wealth than everyone else ; Bill Gates does n't eat a million times the amount of food that a regular person does .

Fertilizers include things plants need such as nitrogen , potassium , and phosphorus . Nitrogen for example is another thing that comes straight from the air through the action of bacteria .

This is when farmers plant different types of crops in a particular field each year. For example, one year they might plant a crop that uses up a lot of nitrogen, like corn. The next year, they might plant a crop that puts nitrogen back into the soil, like beans. By rotating the types of crops they plant, farmers help keep the soil balanced and healthy.\\n\\nAnother way to replenish the nutrients in soil is by adding fertilizers.

Voltage is like water pressure - imagine a dam holding a bunch of water back . That 's like your battery . Resistance is how much the dam resists letting the water through . A battery that 's not connected to anything has basically infinite resistance , and holds its charge . As soon as you connect it to a wire though , you 've made a hole in the dam . The amount of water that flows through the hole is the current . Something with a very low resistance , like just a naked wire connected to both ends , is like a giant hole in the dam . Just as water would rush through all at once and cause a lot of noise , your wire will pass a lot of current at once and get dangerously hot . It 's important to have an appropriate amount of resistance along your circuit so that the current goes through at a controlled rate to power your device . In your case , your heating element is kind of like a water wheel . You want enough energy flow to get it to work without overwhelming it . Ohm 's law is the relationship between current , voltage and resistance and you can use it to ensure that you 're getting the kind of flow you want .

The water is like electricity, and the hose is like a wire. The wider the hose, the more water can flow through it at once. The narrower the hose, the less water can flow through it at the same time.\\n\\nIn the same way, the width of the wire (also called the cross-sectional area) affects how much electricity can flow through it. A wider wire allows more electricity to flow, while a narrower wire allows less electricity to flow.\\n\\nThe resistance of a wire is like the narrowness of the hose. The more resistance a wire has, the harder it is for electricity to flow through it.\\n\\nOhm's Law states that the current (the flow of electricity) in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage (the pressure of the electricity) and inversely proportional to the resistance. This means that if you increase the voltage, the current will also increase. On the other hand, if you increase the resistance, the current will decrease.\\n\\nHere is the mathematical formula for Ohm's Law:\\n\\nI = V/R\\n\\nWhere I is the current in amperes (A), V is the voltage in volts (V), and R is the resistance in ohms (Ω).\\n\\nI hope this helps!

I mean , all the programming I 've done so far is in java and C # , but how do they make all those words that i write , be understood by the hardware ? Explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["* * In short :* * The compiler does that for you . It translates your words -- which already follow certain rules to be understood by your compiler -- into something the underlying hardware can understand . * * A bit less shorter :* * Your source code usually gets preprocessed into a modified source code . That modified sourcecode already contains a few \" machinizations \" ( just some simplifications towards the machine and compile process ) . A compiler creates a assembly language code ( so going from a high level language to a assembly language such as x86 ASM ) . On that level you see operations based on registers instead of variables and objects . The assembly language code gets \" assembly'd \" into a machine code ( decoded ' readable ' assembly into unreadable sequences of numbers ) . The machine code still needs to be arranged and linked with the libraries you use . That gets done by a linker and loader ( in C # you sometimes you dll 's which basically correspond to that ) . The linker and loader takes care of putting the arrangeable machine code into the proper order for the underlying machine . The end result will be the machine code in the pure machine language consisting of the number sequences which the processor reads from a memory byte by byte ( sometimes two bytes or more but that s a different topic ) . * * A side note :* * I talked about compiler languages ( quite generally ) here . There also exist pure interpreter languages like Python or some mixed languages like Java . Those work a bit different but the underlying principle uses similar techniques on the machine level . For interpreter languages we have a interpreter which literally interprets your source code line by line and executes system level operations straight away . This requires these operations to be written and complied once to be available on the interpreter language . So the magic is hidden there . Java on the other hand -- in my opinion -- works in the inbetween way with some additional perks . We have our source code which gets compiled from a .java file into a .class file . This class - File is the java Code compiled into a assembly language like on x86 _ but _ for the Java - Virtual - Machine ( jvm ) . It contains a general set of operations which are available on pretty much any machine . The jvm on the other hand has to be created for every architecture itself . So you have a jvm for x86 , one for ARM , one for amd64 , ... The jvm interpret the Java ASM into machine code instructions straight away for the processor to be interpreted . For further reading I recommend books on computer architecture from Hennessy+Patterson or Tanenbaum ( well when it comes to computer engineering/ comp sci that Tanenbaum guy shows up everywhere i think ... he is great :) ) .

Usually this is a set of codes that can be easily turned into something called \" assembly \" ( you may have heard of it ) . The compiler will also optimize your code in various ways , it will seek to eliminate unnecessary variable declarations etc , I believe this process various a lot and can be customized literally in your code .

Explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Fear is generally a learned response in humans rather than being present from birth . Whenever a human is observing another human as being a role model , the observer sees the response taken by the role model , and is more likely to recreate that response in the future . Because of this , it 's easy to pass on your fear of bugs to another person , as long as that person 's subconscious processing thinks you are worth learning from . On the other hand , some fears are present from birth as a defensive response to tell an animal to run away when presented with a dangerous situation . Most animals do n't fear bugs simply because bugs do n't do anything to the animal . But if you put a cucumber behind a cat while it 's eating , it will panic and run away because it is born with a fear of snakes , and the cat 's innate processing mistakes the cucumber for a threat . It 's likely that our original fear of bugs did come from the knowledge that certain bugs can have bad or even deadly effects on us , which then spread the mentality that we should be afraid of all bugs . For an animal to fear that same bug , it would have to be because of a survival instinct , unless the animal somehow also learned to fear bugs . Edit : apparently the cucumber / snake thing with cats may not be 100 % scientific , but it was the first example that came to mind when thinking of innate fears .","My daughter grew up never afraid of insects or spiders .. then one day .. when she was 5 .. she went to daycare for the first time .. and there she met a bunch of little girls who were raised to be idiots and to scream at spiders .

What is it about the industry that makes it so damaging to the environment ? Explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["As with anything it depends . The easiest to point a finger at is the beef cattle industry so I 'll take a whack at that . Three main reasons : farts , inefficiency , and erosion / runoff . Cows have a sequenced digestive process and they give off a lot of methane . Methane is a greenhouse gas that is much stronger at causing the greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide which is what most people worry about ( think of car pollution and planting trees for carbon offsets ) The meat industry is inefficient with how animals are fed . In terms of resources used to make a single serving , beef has some of the most resources for the smallest amount . This is particularly true for water . Fresh water resources are a difficult thing to manage and meat industries use an incredible amount of water all the way from watering feed crops / pastures to keeping the animals themselves hydrated . Another big issue is erosion and runoff caused by cattle farming . These are mainly a result of how , being an industry , you have areas where there are many hundreds or even thousands of cattle near each other . The sheer physical presence of so many cows causes the landscape to change . Often they will be near a stream or river ( because they need water to drink and irrigate their pastures ) . The change in landscape from so many cows ends up damaging the waterways so much that it is often unable to ever repair itself . Also all the urine from cattle ( not to forget any fertilizer used by the farmer ) causes anything downstream that is n't destroyed to be contaminated . I strayed and talked more about environmental impact and not just pollution but people often use the two terms interchangeably .

{"question":"How do unions work ? I understand their purpose , I just do n't get how they go about achieving that purpose . Explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The basic idea behind a union , is that an individual employee has very little power against the company , but all of the employees rallied together have power . The concept is called collective bargaining . So instead of each employee talking to their manager individually , and having wildly different requests , the employees get together , agree on a few things they want , and then talk to the employer as a group . Unions tend to work in cycles . As employers gain power , they want to do things like increase profits , which usually means lowering costs and increasing output , which sometimes means bad things for workers ( like making them work longer days ) . At some point , the workers get together , form a union , and fight back against the employer to improve their conditions . Then , once the power has shifted back to them , the union atrophies and becomes unnecessary or starts fighting for silly things , so it dissolves . Being able to form a union is incredibly important for our society , because the employer having all the power long term tends to be bad news for the common worker . In societies where forming a union is illegal , it tends to be very oppressive .","Unions came about because workers needed to be able to negotiate with employers and the only way to do that was to be a united front . In order to create an environment at a workplace that is n't killing off workers by overworking them , a union helped set limits on working hours . It also made sure that workers hired for the same job got the same wages , no matter what their race , creed or sex - a newly hired typist would make the same salary as another typist because they were hired in the same job category and level . Before unions , employers could hire people and pay them differently based on their race , creed , sex or any other difference - I 've heard stories about employers hiring women and paying them much less for the same jobs men were doing , or black workers hired at half the wages of a white worker . Unions leveled the playing field . But to do this people had to come together to create a group that could negotiate with employers . A union is a private group , like a civic organization . It collects dues from its members , and uses those dues to fund efforts to keep workers on an even playing field . It pays specialized negotiators to create working contracts that lay out wages , benefits and perks of each job under that union 's perview . It makes sure that bad - faith on the part of the employer can be stood up to by strikes that take profits out of the employers hands . Modern unions in the public sector ( such as teachers unions ) have a similar beginning , but a different outcome today . Modern public unions do not have the same recourse to strike as private sector unions do . The NYS [ Taylor Law ] ( URL_0 ) makes it harder for unions to strike , and many other states have similar law codes . Federal law is being wittled away as well . This is because employers at all levels do not like their profits being wittled away by union needs . Unions were created to help workers achieve some semblance of a good life - a working day that was n't 16 - 18 hours long , a weekend to recover and spend time with family , benefits that helped them when they got sick , pensions that took care of them in old age when they could not work anymore . But today those benefits are being pulled away little by little . Many states do n't want unions in their businesses and have Right to Work laws that make it so that a union can not force workers to be a part of their group at a workplace , can not force workers to pay into union dues . This keeps unions away from many states and keeps workers from making enough to live on or enough to pay for healthcare or other benefits . In short , unions achieve their purpose of insuring that workers are treated well and equally by collecting dues and using those dues to fund negotiations for contracts , benefits and pensions . This is an expensive proposition , so dues are high , but workers get benefits they usually do n't get without a workplace union .","One person goes to the boss and demands a raise or the quit , and the boss will tell them not to let the door hit them on ass on the way out . A hundred people do that , and the boss has to listen or risk losing money . That 's basically how a union works , they negotiated with managed , with the implicit threat they will strike if they do n't get what they want . Unions also collect dues and use those dues to in theory help the members do things they could n't do on their own . They can hire lawyers to make sure labor laws are followed and contracts with the workers are being followed , and they can make political contributions to try to get pro - union politicians elected and hire lobbyists to try to get pro - union laws passed ."],"chatgpt_answers":["\\nUnions are organizations that represent the collective interests of workers.

One reason is that the way light reflects off of a real face is often more complex and subtle than the way it is simulated in a game. In real life, the way light interacts with the various textures and shapes of a face (such as wrinkles, pores, and bumps) creates a unique set of highlights and shadows that help give a face its distinctive appearance. These subtle lighting effects are often difficult to reproduce accurately in a game, so even if the overall shape and color of a face in a game look realistic, the lighting might not be quite right.\\n\\nAnother reason is that faces in real life are often more expressive and animated than those in games. Real faces move and change in response to emotions, speech, and other factors, which can make them more distinctive and easier to recognize. In contrast, the faces of characters in games are often more static and less expressive, which can make them seem less realistic and more artificial.\\n\\nFinally, it's also worth noting that our brains are very good at recognizing and distinguishing between different faces, and we have a lot of practice doing so.

As the powers rack up , though , the disparity gets bigger , and it becomes more of a problem - which is why it 's useful to draw a distinction between MiB and MB , for example .","Computer Engineer here , so this is something that I can talk authoritatively about . Almost all modern computational arithmetic and logic is performed in base-2 . Decade / Decimal arithmetic was used in some very early computers , and is still supported on some instruction sets ( such as IBM mainframes ) via microcode , but it is otherwise long dead and buried . A bit is a single , insular , binary value . A byte is a rank of eight binary values . In computing , the SI prefixes kilo , mega , tera , peta , exa , were adopted in a context specific fashion . In some contexts , they refer to 2 ^ 10 , 2 ^ 20 , 2 ^ 30 , 2 ^ 40 , 2 ^ 50 respectively ; in the remaining contexts they refer to 10 ^ 3 , 10 ^ 6 , 10 ^ 9 , 10 ^ 12 , and 10 ^ 15 respectively . Computer networking has its roots in digital telephony which used 8000 digital samples per second per channel to transmit digital voice data . 8000 samples is sufficient to capture the lower 4Khz of the audible spectrum , which encapsulates most of the human voice . 8000 samples at a sample size of 8 bits per sample ( one byte ) , yielded 64,000 bits per second . This remains the standard for a digital \" voice channel \" today and is usually presented as 64kilobits per second . Since early computer networks operated on top of real time voice channels , transmission rates were constrained by this early design choice . As a result , eight megabits of network traffic does not necessarily translate into a megabyte of storage consumption on a hard disk drive . Digital storage is where things * really * start to get confusing , and understandably so . Hard disks and solid state storage devices are * block devices * , meaning that they are not indexed by bit or by byte , but rather by a larger construct known as a block . Blocks are generally either 512 bytes in size , or 4096 bytes in size depending on the device . The number of blocks on a device is either a power of two , or some integer multiple of a power of two . For reasons that I wo n't go into , integrated design really likes powers of two , followed by multiples of powers of two . Either way , all storage devices are base-2 at their core . With that said , most manufacturers do not expose the entirety of the storage volume to the consumer ; some portion is usually reserved for the storage device itself for redundancy and maintenance purposes . A couple of decades ago , some fuckheads at Western Digital decided to exploit the general public 's ignorance of the contextual meaning of SI prefixes in computing in order to make their hard drives more attractive . They decided to redefine a megabyte as being 10 ^ 6 for the sole reason of making the marketed capacity of the hard disk appear larger on the box by approximately 10 % . There was no technical or logical reason for this decision so it raised the ire of OS designers everywhere as they now had to resolve inconsistencies in how storage space was presented to the user . Windows , for example , presents the storage space in absolute bytes as well as base-2 with SI prefixes ; eg , 29,615,529,984 bytes free , or 27.5 GB . In order to resolve the ambiguity of SI prefixes in a binary world , binary prefixes were created . They are the Kibibit , Mebibit , Gibibit , Tebibit , etc ... and are presented as Kib , Mib , Gib , Tib , etc ... They are powers of two by definition ."],"chatgpt_answers":["\\nA kilobyte is actually equal to 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes.

How do they know what the air is like before they 've flew into it ? Explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["They get reports from other planes in the area , primarily . They also have weather radar that can help them see storms and other disturbances . There are also areas that basically always have it ( like coming over the Rockies into Denver )","Air is not stationary . Warm air rises , cool air descends . This causes bodies of air with different temperatures to move . When you 're standing on the ground , you experience this as wind . The air is moving along the earth 's surface and since you 're more or less anchored to that surface , you feel the air move past you . Think of turbulence like this : there are all these bodies of air that have varying temperatures and as a result move in different directions . While you remain in a single column of air , you do n't notice much turbulence . Sure the plane might rise a bit if you 're in a column of rising air or descend a bit if you 're in a column of descending air but the pilot will adjust for it without you realising . But if you move from , say , a column of rising air to a column of descending air , you might get quite a bump . After all , the plane is just trying to move forward and suddenly the surrounding air goes from lifting it up to pushing it down . And if you end up in an area where upwardly and downwardly pockets of air are swirling around each other , you get a pretty bumpy ride . As for how they predict it ... since turbulence is caused by columns of air that move in different directions , you look at factors that influence turbulence . For instance , clouds are a good way of visualising air movement . If you see a big fluffy cloud that has towers growing out of it , those towers are cloud vapour rising on warm air currents . Paragliders and sailplane gliders often aim for those hoping to rise higher in the thermals . Ridges in the terrain like hills and mountains can create updrafts where horizontally moving air hits the landscape like a skateboarder going up a ramp . Those often have predictable turbulence . Weather is another good indicator . When warm fronts meet cold fronts the result is predictably a lot of moving air .","They sometimes gets reports from airplanes ahead of them but mostly it is years of experience . Turbulence can happen in a lot of situations and there are a few things you can look for to recognize patterns that can create turbulence . The easiest and most common form is to look for cumulus clouds . These are clouds formed in a hot day when hot air from the ground rises up in columns . As the air rises the pressure drops which creates condensation and you therefore get a puffy mushroom cloud . These clouds usually have strong turbulence around them as the columns of hot rising air is moving a lot of air around . This type of turbulence is easy to spot as it have a very distinct cloud pattern in it . However there are lots of other types of events that can create turbulence . For example if you are downwind of a mountain range there can be turbulence . If you are closely following another big aircraft there can be turbulence . And lots of other things .

{"question":"how do mathematicians know pi is irrational ? The main answer I 'm looking for is how they know it does n't repeat itself . If it goes on and on forever , how can we know that at some point it does n't just sneakily start over ? Explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["There are ways to prove a number is irrational . For example , [ here 's ] ( URL_0 ) a pretty simple proof that the square root of 2 is irrational . Unfortunately , the proof that pi is irrational is probably way to complicated to ELI5 . It was n't proven until the 1700s , which is testament to how complex it is . [ Here 's ] ( URL_1 ) a list of proofs . If a number is irrational , that means its decimal expansion never falls into a recursive pattern .","[ Here ] ( URL_0 ) is a simple proof that pi is irrational . All it requires is basic calculus . The idea is as follows : Assume that pi = A / B is a rational number . Then we can construct a function of the form f(x ) = x^(n ) ( A - Bx)^(n)/n ! , where n is any positive integer . To get a feel for what a function like this looks like , see [ this ] ( URL_1 ) , where it is done for 22/7 , rather than pi , and n=3 . In particular , it will pass through x=0 , make a bump and then come back down to pass through the x - axis at x = A / B. So if pi = A / B , then this will make a bump between x=0 and x = pi . Another function that does this is sin(x ) . It passes through x=0 and then makes a bump before passing through x = pi . So if we make the function f(x)sin(x ) , then it will do this too . The interesting thing about f(x)sin(x ) is that the area under the graph from x=0 to x = pi ( so under the bump ) will always be an integer . Intuitively , this is pretty believable because the area under sin(x ) from x=0 to x = pi is 2 , and f(x ) is a polynomial with nice , rational coefficients which interact nicely ( this is explicitly found by applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral ) . So we have a function , f(x)sin(x ) , whose are under its graph between x=0 and x = pi is an integer . But this function passes through the x - axis at x=0 and x = pi and hits its maximum value at x = pi/2 , in the middle . Here sin(pi/2)=1 and f(pi/2 ) = pi^(n)(A - B(A/2B))^(n)/n ! = pi^(n)A^(n)/2^(n)n ! . This means that the total area under the curve is * less * than pi^(n+1)A^(n)/2^(n)n ! . The interesting thing about factorials is that they are , generally , bigger than exponents . This means that , regardless of what A is , we can always choose n to be large enough so that pi^(n+1)A^(n)/2^(n ) < n ! . But then the area , which is a positive integer , is less than pi^(n+1)A^(n)/2^(n)n ! which is less than 1 . There are no positive integers less than 1 , so we must not be able to make the function f(x ) , which means that pi can not be rational .","Because we know it because it ca n't be a rational number . ( warning , math ahead ) A rational number is one that can be represented as a ratio of two integers . For any repeating or terminating decimal out there , you can do a little math to express it as a ratio . With a terminating decimal , it is pretty easy : 0.123 = 123/1000 Repeating decimals require a little algebra : n = 0.123123 ... 1000n = 123.123123 ... 1000n - n = 999n = 123 n = 123/999 = 41/333 What does this have to do with pi ? It means that either a ) pi can be expressed as a ratio of two integers , or b ) pi can not be represented as a terminating or repeating decimal . If we can show there is no way to express pi as a ratio , the only remaining possibility is a nonrepeating decimal . In 1761 , this is exactly what Johann Heinrich Lambert did . Unfortunately , his proof , and others like it , require advanced math we 'd rather not get into . Lucky for us , the proof that √2 is irrational is pretty straight forward and demonstrates how one might go about this kind fo proof : assume a and b exist , such that a / b = √2 , and a and b have no common factors a^2 / b^2 = 2 a^2 = 2 * b^2 therefore a is even , and there exists a k such that a = 2k ( 2 * k)^2 = 2 * b^2 4 * k^2 = 2 * b^2 2 * k^2 = b^2 therefore b is also even However , we assumed a and b had no common factors , so they can not both be even .

{"question":"How are Nuclear Missiles Safely Decommissioned ? Say during a nuclear arms treaty that states reduces the number of nukes they can have . How exactly are the nukes ' disarmed ' ? Explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Nuclear warheads fitted to ICBM 's and SLBM 's are not really warheads in the same sense as an artillery round . They are in fact a small and complex machine fitted inside a heat resistant and aerodynamic shell . It might be easier to think of them as miniature spacecraft . One nuclear missile will carry several warheads and they will seperate to attack different targets or the same target multiple times . These are called MIRV or Multiple Independent Re - Entry Vehicle . Because they are basically machines , they are designed to be taken apart and maintained . The pit or the nuclear element of the warhead is just one component . It can be removed and in fact very often is removed from the warhead for things like testing ( Where it is replaced by an inert device ) and routine maintenance . The decommissioning process varies depending on the terms of the treaty . In some cases it is simply a case of reducing the number of MIRV 's the missile carries say from 12 to 8 . If physical removal is required it is a case of removing the nuclear element of the warhead and putting it into storage or use as a fuel , while recycling or destroying the components of the MIRV . The missiles themselves are rarely destroyed in entirety , they or their components often have useful secondary peaceful applications . There are a number of common misconceptions about ICBM 's , SLBM 's and nuclear warheads and their MIRV delivery system . One is that their guidance components use GPS to guide them into their targets . This is in fact not true . These missiles must reach their target and relying on GPS might harm their chances of that happening if the GPS system where to be attacked . So the majority of ICBM / SLBM use celestial navigation ( The positions of the stars ) to guide them into their targets . They do n't have to be super accurate . A circular error of probability of half a mile is acceptable . Russian missiles used to have massive payloads to make up for their less accurate guidance systems . It really does n't matter if your off target by 3 miles if you ramp up the explosive power by 10 megatons ! For this reason you will often see US missiles use smaller warheads than their russian counterparts . Another common misconception is that the warheads have some communication component that offers an ability to communicate with it after launch and give a recall or cancellation ability , so if a missile is fired in some sort of accidental launch scenario it can be communicated with and made inert or to blow itself up without going nuclear . This is also not true and is a myth perpetrated by Hollywood . The risks of an enemy finding out how to communicate with the missile and destroy it would be too great . These weapons are designed to be the ultimate and last deterrent . The missile , once fired , communicates with nothing and no - one . It is a self contained system that once the button has been pressed , will carry out it 's mission to it 's final horrifying end unless it is somehow intercepted externally . --- EDIT : Clarified decommissioning process and celestial navigation and the fact I may not have mentioned inertial guidance clearly enough . To clarify the correct term is astro - inertial guidance in that the \" majority \" of ICBM 's and SLBM 's ( Lest we not forget the US developed versions are not the only types of these horrific weapons ) use both , with inertial guidance being responsible for initial and re - entry guidance and celestial for mid course correction . So celestial navigation is the tracking of your position by looking at where you are in relation to the stars , because where you are and the time of day defines what you can see and where they should be in the night sky . It 's not an overly complex skill and we have been doing it for a very long time . It 's kind of fallen out of use in these days of GPS . Ships at sea would use a sextant to help them plot their position relative to the time of the day and the position of the stars which was why getting accurate clocks on board ships was such a big deal many years ago . In fact the earliest Boeing 747 aircraft had a porthole in their cockpit roofs to allow the crew to use celestial navigation should the need arise ! Obviously celestial navigation is of more use at night and in good weather if your on the ground , but ICBM 's and SLBM 's do n't need to worry about this as within the space of about 30 seconds they are high enough to begin using it without either of these concerns as they use inertial guidance in their initial launch . The missile and MIRV 's basically have a digital version of a sextant on board . If you would like to see a vaguely similar approximation of how they work , I suggest you download the [ Sky app \\(Formerly Google Sky\\ ) ] ( URL_0 ) , which allows you to use your phone to plot the stars in the sky ( Though Google augments this with GPS data so they cheat a little bit ) .","Simplifying what others have said ; 1 ) remove component warhead parts and break down further . The radioactive material is often reprocessed into the nuclear power industry . 2 ) remove fuel component from missile . Liquid fuelled missiles are typically only fuelled just prior to launch . Solid fuel missiles are a little more complicated . Rocket fuel can be rather toxic depending upon the type . 3 ) missile body is then often cut up and left exposed to satellite observation , or observers from the opposite side of the treaty are there watching the destruction processes . Sometimes both . 4 ) the silos/ mobile launchers can also be destroyed depending upon the treaty . Observers & satellites monitor this . When Kazakhstan became nuclear free the US and Russians were present on the ground . The warheads went back to Russia and monitored into the nuclear fuel industry . The silos were systemically destroyed , with additional work undertaken every ~6 months . I have photos of several of the Kazak silos going through phased destruction back in the mid to late ' 90 's .","Nuclear weapons were designed to be maintained ( fixed ) .

Explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Humans have been domesticating dogs for a * long * time and it is arguably easier to do this because they started out as a communal pack animal . Bears tend to be much more of a loner species so taming them is even more difficult considering the lack of instincts to hijack with domestication . It also is n't obvious why a human would really want to tame a bear for use as a survival companion . Bears need significantly more food than dogs which would take resources away from the humans . Also the hunting style of humans does n't tend to favor the use of bears : Humans are extremely good at running down prey through persistence and cooperation which complement the hunting style of wolves from which dogs descend , while bears do n't hunt that way at all . A bear likely could n't keep up with a human 's running pace ( although in a sprint they would beat a human ) and once they arrived their superior physical power is n't needed because the human with the spear is going to be able to kill anything they encounter anyway . The role of the dog or bear would only be to corner and hold the prey for the human to kill , so a dog holding on to the back leg of a boar is good enough . Finally dogs breed a lot faster than bears which is of great importance when many people need domesticated animals . If you go a year hunting with twelve dogs and you lose one because it got gored by a boar then you are still OK , but if you have two bears and one gets killed then you are in real trouble .","The ability to be comes to rated relies on 4 key attributes . Friendly - An animal needs to at least be open to not attacking people on sight Feedability - They ca n't require special diets . They either need to eat what we eat , or eat something we can not eat but is ABUNDANTLY available . Fecund - They need to reproduce easily and/or in great numbers . Family - oriented - They need to be open to working as a group . Let 's look at wolves / dogs . They have a pack - based community which humans can fit into , they do n't immediately attack humans , they reproduce easily ( 3 months for 5 puppies , about 6 months to maturity ) , and they eat everything while specializing in fat and marrow which humans do n't digest as well while only requiring about 4 cups of food per day maximum . Now let 's look at bears . They are largely solitary with adult males being so aggressive as to attack and sometimes consume their own young , they like to attack people , and they take a long time to reproduce ( 5 cubs every 2 years , about 5 years to maturity ) , while they do eat everything they eat a lot ( 90lbs / day ) . They just are n't cost effective . For the cost of raising war bears you can have horses as well as a pack of warhounds .","Every domesticated animal is social in the wild . Like vampires , humans infiltrated cattle herds and inserted ourselves into them , becoming their ruler . We infiltrated sheep and wolves and horses . Bears are not social . We ca n't infiltrate their society because they do n't have one ."],"chatgpt_answers":["\\nWhile it is true that humans have domesticated many animals, including wolves, we have not been able to successfully domesticate other large predators, such as bears, in the same way. There are a few reasons why this is the case:\\n\\nBears are much larger and stronger than wolves: Bears are much larger and stronger than wolves, which makes them more difficult to control and train. They also have powerful jaws and claws, which can be dangerous to humans.\\n\\nBears have different behaviors and needs: Bears also have different behaviors and needs than wolves, which makes it more difficult to domesticate them. For example, bears are more independent and territorial than wolves, which makes it harder to train them to be social and obedient.\\n\\nBears may not be as well suited to domestication: Finally, it is possible that bears may not be as well suited to domestication as wolves and other animals. This could be due to differences in their biology, behavior, or other factors that make it more difficult for them to adapt to living with humans.\\n\\nOverall, while humans have been able to domesticate wolves and other animals, we have not been able to do the same for bears.

There was estimated to be at most 90 millions Native Americans scattered across the Americas , and many as 90 % were killed off by disease alone . What was left of the natives were often enslaved or driven off by the technologically superior European Settlers who arrived in droves to either escape persecution or make money .

{"question":"Why is it that some people with brain disabilities such as autism have such good memories but struggle with other cognitive functions ? I do n't understand why people with autism , for example , often have extremely accurate memories yet struggle with things like reading and writing Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Additionally autism is now basically a catch - all diagnosis . Every new edition of the DSM adds symptoms and imho it 's being massively over diagnosed at the moment . But to answer your question the brain is divided into regions with each region being responsible for a specific task . Examples are processing visual input from the eyes , muscle control , regulating emotions , controlling breathing etc . Most brain disorders only affect one or a few of these regions , leaving everything else working normally . Often the brain compensates by using another region to do the task of the broken region , but this is a bit like having one person do the work of two people . It 's more hard work and the results are suboptimal . This is why some people with high - functioning autism / Asperger syndrome are virtually undetectable . Their brains have compensated , but they may be consciously applying rules of social interaction that they 've learnt rather than it being an automatic process . Where an unaffected person would know that someone who is trying to change the topic of conversation is n't interested in the current conversation someone with Asperger syndrome would need to consciously recognise the body language and other signs that this is happening , compare that to previous conversations and figure out that 's what 's happening . Someone without the condition would do this automatically and may not even recognise it 's happening . As you can imagine being able to hold down a complex conversation whilst simultaneously analysing the body language and subtle social cues of the people you 're talking with is harder than doing one or the other . This is why some people with the condition just do one or the other , and will keep talking as you get more and more uncomfortable . 🤣 Edit : /u / DuplexFields points out below that DSM - V narrowed the scope of autism .

{"question":"Why in Australia is Liberal deemed right - wing , when in America it means the opposite ? It makes watching American politics on youtube that tiny bit harder . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["To understand this a brief history of liberalism and conservatism is needed . Liberals emerged in opposition to the European monarchies and favored individual liberty . As liberalism evolved , they became divided on how to best pursue liberty . Initially , liberals generally sought freedom from government coercion . Other liberals argued that the least well - off needed to be helped by the state to truly obtain liberty . The division is basically between how much the government should intervene into the economy with classical liberals on the more free market side and social liberals on the more state - welfare side . Due to this history , a lot of European \" liberal \" parties are rather centrist . The US is strange because the libertarians and conservatives ( pre - Trump ) were actually pretty close to classical liberals . The social liberals are more like the moderate Democrats . Plus , the far left parties in Europe have strong communist and socialist influences that are absent in the US . Also , the conservative parties were the \" Church and State \" people that defended the monarchies . The US also did n't have that same dynamic . And of course , the US always has to be unique so we call anyone on the left \" liberals \" and those on the right are conservative . So the Aussies probably have things labeled correctly and it 's the US that 's making things difficult . Related - The right and the left is not the same in every country . For instance a labor party might be center - right in country A , but center - left in another country B even if they have the same positions because country A and B are ideologically different as a whole .","It is the use of the term \" liberal \" in the sense of \" classical liberal \" , which is something closer to \" libertarian \" . The US uses the word \" liberal \" in the sense of \" social liberalism \" , which basically means \" left - wing \" . The other senses of meaning of the word liberal seem to have been lost over there . The modern Australian Liberal Party came about in the mid 1940s after a series of previous different conservative parties had fallen over . It was called ' Liberal ' basically for two reasons . Partly it was to sort of honour the former ' Liberal Party ' of the 1900s , which was the first major conservative party in independent Australia . And partly it was due to the circumstances of the time : Immediately post - war , the ruling Labor party was trying to use Post - War Reconstruction to pursue a range of Socialist , Big Government policies such as nationalising the banks . The conservatives positioned themselves as \" Liberals \" in the libertarian sense of being opposed to this sort of government interference in private enterprise . Which of course , is a fairly typical conservative position . So while it might look funny to Americans , there is no ideological inconsistency in the use of the word Liberal . As with other countries , the ideology of both major parties has hardened over time , so the Liberal Party is more explicitly \" conservative \" and \" right - wing \" these days . You occasionally see people on both the Right ( enthusiastically ) and Left ( pejoratively ) proposing the party be renamed to The Conservative Party as in the UK .","Good question . Technically in terms of ideology they SHOULD be the same . If you look in any Poli - Sci text book it 'll tell you that the number one plank of liberalism is a belief in the supremacy of the individual , and the freedom of said individual to live their life as they choose , so long as they do n't interfere with the freedom of anyone else . You may have heard the expression ' laisez - faire ' . That is essentially what that means . But , as you 've probably realised the real world rarely sits neatly with what text books say . In Australia at least the Liberal Party , while including people people who identify as liberal in the sense described above , it also contains people who identify as conservative . They tend to drag the party toward the right on the political spectrum . Also , left and right are relative terms . The alternative party in Australia is the Labor Party . The labor party is the political arm of the union movement and is more interested in collective rights over the individual . While there are ' liberals ' in the labor party , and in terms of social policy there are similarities with liberals in the US , the labor party also includes people that identify as socialist or even communist .

First they state a list of points and their order matters .

Almost all of this is entirely unnecessary for any sort of 3D rendering or video games . Editors support scripting languages and/or plugin APIs to export these files to some target format you describe . No video game or render software ( at least that I know of ) uses editor files directly . Video game files will often also have a lot of embedded meta - data for sounds , hooks , queues , and animation sequences . At the most basic level , polygonal models need a set of 3 3D points to describe the polygons . Typically these are going to be 4 - byte floats in sequence of 3 for the X , Y , and Z components . If we 're talking a binary format , there will be some integer type indicating how many points are described in sequence . The coordinates are in model space and relative to the origin at 0 , 0 , 0 . There 's no guarantee the data is in this order , there could be three sequences , one for each of the component dimensions , for example . The points will likely be unique , and they do n't by themselves describe a polygon . A second sequence will index the first , a sequence of 3 integers each that describe the three points that make a single polygon . The order of these points matter , as they will follow either the right - hand or left - hand rule . This indicates which side of the polygon is the front and which is the back , so you can perform backface culling . Typically , the artist is going to center the model about the origin , but that 's no guarantee - the XZ plane can also be the floor upon which the model was drawn just as often . There can be a sequence of normal vectors which either index with the points , the polygons , or all the points of a polygon , for lighting . There can also be 2D UV coordinates to map textures onto the model . There may also be lists of image files for textures , masks , or normals . These textures can be mip - mapped , or their binaries could be embedded right in the file . I can go on and on .

{"question":"Why ca n't we just bomb a foreign power where they store their nukes ?

","human_answers":["Within the framework of M.A.D ( Mutually Assured Destruction ) , a power with the ability to launch a nuclear attack that can cripple the enemies ability to respond has what s called * First Strike * capability . * Second Strike * capability is if a nation can respond in kind to a nuclear attack , the other side does n't have * First Strike * over them . Within the context of the Cold War and US v USSR , both sides were scared shitless of the other achieving First Strike capability and so were endlessly beefing up their own arsenals and technology to at least hold on too * Second Strike * capability . The only way to prevent the other side from attacking you , is to make sure you are strong enough to hit back , Deterrence Theory in a nutshell . They did this in a lot of ways . To begin with ( not long after WWII , the 50 's roughly ) , there were just nuclear bombs , ICBM 's ( Inter - Continental Ballistic Missiles ) did n't exist yet . The US set up a rotating system of bombers carrying nuclear weapons flying 24/7 near the Soviet borders ready to retaliate against a USSR invasion of Europe , with pre - written orders to be carried out if certain criteria were met . I do nt know what exactly the Soviets had like this in turn but I imagine it was something similar , ready to attack European targets . So 24/7 you had a bunch of planes flying around with nuclear bombs , its not a simple task to just shoot them down in an age before ballistic missile technology was really all that developed . Around the 1960 's , ICBM 's were starting to become a thing , which made it a lot harder . Both sides developed a ton of them , hid them around their nation ( and allies ) inside fortified silos . To take them all out with your own missiles , you would need to * A ) Know where they all are . * B ) Be able to hit them precisely enough to do any real damage ( this was a big issue early on , the first few generations of ICBM could only reliably hit something the size of a city ) . * C ) Have multiple missiles for every silo the enemy had ( they were tough ) . * D ) Destroy them quickly enough that they ca nt fire back in time . * E ) Have even more missiles to shoot at conventional targets like cities and military bases , because you need to do more than just blow up their missiles . * F ) Have even more missiles on top of that , because both sides were also developing systems to shoot down ICBM 's to defend themselves , the Soviets in particular . So you might need to dedicate multiple missiles to guarantee a hit on important targets . and both sides knew this , so they both just kept building more and more silos and missiles . So pretty much at that point it became really unfeasible for either side to knock each others nuclear capability offline with their own strike , as you would need to quickly destroy their bombers and ICBM 's . The development of Nuclear Submarines really put the last nail in the coffin and finished what s now known as \" The Nuclear Triad \" . Submarines can get very close to a countries borders ( limiting the potential of defense systems ) , can easily hide just by diving , are super difficult to destroy remotely and can potentially surface months after a nuclear exchange to launch their payload .

{"question":"Stalinism vs Maoism vs Trotsykism I see these varieties of communism referenced but I do n't understand the difference . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Stalinism does n't exist . It 's basically a slur for anyone who loves Stalin . But usually it references the tendency of Marxist - Leninism . Before showing what the difference between Marxist - Leninism , Trotskyists , and Maoism ( short for Marxist - Leninist - Maoism ) you must know what Marxism is . Marxism is a body of analysis and critique of capitalism . It forms the basis of the worldview of communists and it is the utter rejection of liberalism . Marxism is considered by communists to be a science in that it is a constantly developing theory shaped by a cycle of making theory , practicing it ( applying it to the real world ) , and then changing the theory to accommodate for what works and what does n't . Marxism also assumes the world to be ever changing so it develops as the world evolves . Marxist - Leninism is considered to be a major scientific advancement of Marxism and also differs from Marxism in that it is n't solely analysis and critique , but also a description of how revolution should occur , how we organize the workers , how society should look like , and how to continue combating capitalism and liberal ideology after revolution . Some of the major advancements include : -**Analysis of imperialism * * , how rich Western countries maintain overall high living standards , wealth , and decadence by exploiting the Global South ( what some people today would call world systems theory , neoliberalism , or ' globalism ' ) . -**The vanguard party * * , posits that the revolution must be organized in order to be successful . The most devoted workers form what is called a vanguard party which acts as the central leadership in revolution , and after revolution becomes the government . -Indepth analysis of the state and how it can be a tool of oppression depending on which class controls it . -Posits and proves that revolution is more likely and more successful in developing and more exploited Global South countries . -**The Peasantry is Revolutionary * * , it is recognized that the peasantry is also an oppressed class with similar interests to industrial workers . In agrarian societies like Tsarist Russia , uniting the proletariat and peasantry is necessary for successful revolution . -Creates the idea of * * Left wing nationalism * * as a nationalism for oppressed people / nations that is compatible with communist internationalism . -**Socialism In One Country * * , the strategy of a socialist state after revolution should be to rebuild and fortify itself against possible counter revolution or invasion / coup / embargo by the West , rather than take an immediate active stance in exporting revolution to other countries . Trotskyism is in opposition to Marxist - Leninism . Leon Trotsky , Bolshevik revolutionary , believed the Soviet Union was abandoning internationalism and was also losing touch with its workers , so he created a new theory that is based on Marxism , is similar to Marxist - Leninism , but rejects some of the advancements and contributes new analysis of its own . Some of these things were : -Rejection of Socialism In One Country for * * Permanent Revolution * * , a socialist state after revolution must immediately devote as many military and economic resources as possible to exporting revolution to the entire world , so as to subvert capitalism as fast as possible . -Posits the * * Degenerated Worker 's state theory * * which says that the USSR was becoming ' degenerated ' or slowly giving way to a new bureaucratic class with interests of its own to the detriment of the workers . -**United Front and Antifa * * , Trotsky was the first person to recognize that fascism was not only worse than liberalism but the greatest threat to communism ever faced . He believed that communists should do whatever it takes to combat fascism , including fighting on the streets AND temporarily siding with liberals ( United Front ) . This is also Trotsky 's most important contribution , so important that all tendencies of communism from anarchism to Maoism have accepted it and implemented it . Maoism , short for Marxist - Leninist - Maoism​ , is a scientific advancement of Marxist - Leninism as the name suggests . Currently it is the most popular communist tendency in the world , especially in the Global South . Maoism is not as a big jump from Marxist - Leninism as Marxist - Leninism was from Marxism . Here are a list of some of its advancements : -**Protracted Peoples War * * , strategy for revolution which says that the best way to win is to use guerilla warfare and make the war last as long as possible so as to outlast the state and bleed out Western support . -**The Mass Line * * , the best keep the Communist party in tune with the people by taking the unorganized ideas and aspirations of the people and forge policy out of it . -**Theory of Social Imperialism * * , in many ways this is similar to Trotsky 's Degenerated Workers State theory but Social Imperialism theory is considered more accurate , developed , and comprehensive . It posits that the USSR succumbed to revisionism ( which is the unscientific rewriting of Marxism ) and started engaging in imperialism , an act previously thought to be exclusive to capitalism . Many also conclude from this theory that the USSR was no longer socialist after Khrushchev took power . -**Cultural Revolution * * , Mao recognized that a threat to communism would not just come from the outside but also from the inside in the form of revisionism , and if nothing was done to stop it then it would slowly deteriorate and destroy socialism . Cultural Revolution is a method of stopping revisionism by actively finding and removing members of the party and the state who pretend to be communist and do not believe or care about workers liberation , and to continue the fire of revolutionary fervor in the population by having the people take an active effort in fighting dated or oppressive cultural traditions , and destroying positive symbols of the capitalist past . -**\"Class struggle only intensifies under socialism \" * * , a new understanding of socialism that reinforces the importance of taking defense very seriously and actively . It is said that class struggle intensifies under socialism because instead of strikes , riots , and insurrection , there is now proxy wars , coups , spies , covert warfare , and more . The capitalist class will do whatever it takes to hold power , and so will the workers , resulting in intensified struggle on a global scale .","There 's probably a lot of tedious differences that the nice folks at /r / socialism will be happy to explain to you in way too much detail but the main differences are these : Trotskyism : Trotsky believed that the only way to achieve long - lasting communist utopia was to ignite a \" global revolution \" where capitalism worldwide is overthrown and replaced with a single communist society . This is contrasted with ... Stalinism : which believes in \" socialism in one country \" , i.e. the USSR could survive as a single communist entity and still compete with the capitalist world . Stalinism is also what you think of when you think of the stereotypical USSR : purging political dissidents , rapid , centrally - planned industrialization , and collectivized resources . Maoism : Maoism was Mao 's take on socialist revolution as applied to the socio - political climate of china at the time . Mao believed that the peasant class , as opposed to the worker class in Russia , was the key class of a socialist revolution in China , and his policies were mainly geared towards ( in theory ) improving the lives of peasants through policies like teaching all of the peasants how to forge iron and having them keep small - scale forges on their property or teaching them to exterminate pests to increase their crop yields . These policies would turn out to massively backfire but that 's neither here nor there .","Stalin and Trotsky were both proletariat communists . Mao was an agrarian communist . In more simple words Stalin and Trotsky believed in the workers struggle ( more in line with Marx though Marx thought it would happen in industrial nations ) . Mao believed in the farmers struggle . Stalin believed in communism in the nation . Stalin wanted to strengthen the USSR rather than expand the revolution . I also believe Stalin wanted to get rid of the SFSR Russia and SSRs in the USSR . Rather than a federal nation have a one nation policy similar to the former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli . Stalin was more to the right ( in the bolsheviks so still very far to the left ) . Trotsky was a military commander and wanted a global revolution , the USSR should invade the other Bourgeois nations and make them good SSRs . His view on this is similar to the French President and Emperor Napoleon I. Trotsky was to the left in the Bolsheviks . Trotsky was also the legitimate successor to Lenin as leader but a conspiracy led by Stalin robbed him of this . Mao did n't believe in the workers struggle but the farmers and focused his revolution on this .

{"question":"How are these snails floating on the underside of the water ? in this post URL_0 the op says his snails are so small the the surface tension allows them to float on it which i kinda get but a more thorough explanation would be cool Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["These particular pictures look like the snails are working with a mucus layer , so I 'd have to be able to see the whole tank to tell you what 's happening for sure . We 'd see this a lot in Beta fish tanks . The Betas ( a.k.a . \" fighting fish \" ) are native to a flood plain that only really floods seaonally . So they \" fight \" for the depressions because most of the tiny divots can not support two fish for the dry season . They also produce a thick slime / mucus that floats to the surface of their fist - sized dollop of water . This mucus layer slows evaporation and so increases the chance that their little blob of water will survive until the next rainy season . This is why you can keep a beta in a literal cup ( eight fluid ounces ) of water for months at a time . The mucus is quite thick and slimy . The snails are very small , so they can stick to that mucus layer and crawl along it quite easily . Now other fish have similar mutations for similar reasons so in a still water tank you 'll get surface scum where various material joins with the water 's \" surface tension \" to make a surprisingly strong layer of one composition or another . It 's not strong compared to your finger , but it 's strong compared to the more - or - less neutrally buoyant snail 's means of propulsion . And even in clean water with virtually no scum the water 's surface tension is pretty strong to start with , and the mucus from the snail 's foot is going to let it create the needed thickness . --- Beneath all this is the question of \" what is surface tension \" in water . If you look at an water molecule it 's one Oxygen and two Hydrogen atoms . This forms a little \" V \" shape because the Oxygen atom is about eight times larger than the hydrogen . The Oxygen needs to \" borrow \" an electron from each of the Hydrogens so it gets very minus - ee , and the hydrogen 's one electron each spends so much of it 's time servicing the Oxygen atom 's needs that the two hydrogens get very plus - ee . Basically if you draw that \" V \" shape and put two little pluses , one on top of each horn of the \" V \" and put a big minus under the point at the bottom , you 've done a decent job of making a \" charge map \" of the water molecule . Now the plus - ee parts of any one \" V \" are going to be attracted to the minus - ee parts of another V. This is called the \" hydrogen bond \" . So if you made a bunch of these V , like if you printed a bunch of large \" V\"s and cut them out , you could make shapes by lining up the pluses and minuses . It turns out that the water molecule shape is slightly wider spread than most Vs in fonts . In particular if you put six together plus - to - minus it would make a circle with six outward - pointing pluses . ( This is why snowflakes are six - pointed if they are flat , more minuses stick to the six outward pointed pluses , and so on . So in the full thickness of the water the V 's are arranged in three dimensions . They are pointed in every conceivable direction . But at the surface of the water they do n't want to point their pluses up into the air . So at the surface they tend to form a \" mat \" Some of their pluses point down into the water , and the rest are horizontal . So the surface of the water is a tightly laced arrangement of pluses stuck to minuses . This interlocked mat of molecules is so strong that it can hold up things . Heavy things like bugs ( look up \" water strider \" ) and sewing needles ( a fun science experiment ) . What 's strong from above is strong from below .

Mystery snails in particular are my favorite because they 're known for \" parasnailing \" . Parasnailing is when they climb something tall within the tank ( a plant , decor , or just the glass wall of said tank ) and jump off , letting all of the air out of their shells . I had one snail that did basically nothing else with his day - every time I looked over , he was climbing the glass and jumping off ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure! Snails are animals that have a hard, protective outer shell. They are able to swim by using a muscular foot to push off the ground or other surfaces. When they are in the water, the weight of their body and shell is supported by the water, which is denser than the air. This means that the water is able to hold them up, and they are able to float on the surface or move through the water.\\n\\nHowever, when a snail is floating on the underside of the water, it is not being supported by the water in the same way. Instead, the snail is being held up by the surface tension of the water. Surface tension is a property of liquids that causes them to behave as if they have a thin, elastic skin on the surface. This can allow small objects to float on the surface of the water, or even walk on it, as long as they are light enough and their feet are small enough not to break the surface tension.\\n\\nSo in the case of the snails in the photo, they are able to float on the underside of the water because they are small enough and light enough that the surface tension of the water is able to support their weight.

{"question":"Why is it a bad idea to pay off one loan with another loan ? I know there has to be a catch somewhere but when I looked it up I could find none . You ca n't just Dodge interest to a bank like that right ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["You pay interest every month on a loan . If the second loan is much shorter and/or at a lower interest rate this can be a good idea to save money overall . That 's called \" refinancing \" and it happens all the time . If the new loan is n't really different than the previous one then you 're just wasting the loan origination fees . Banks do n't extend new loans for free .","The short answer is that it is NOT a bad idea ... at least not always . It 's the specifics that matter . If you have a high interest loan and you can pay it off with a lower interest loan , then that 's usually going to be a good idea - it 's debt consolidation and/or management and it 's smart , but it 's not very often that you can get a significantly better interest rate because when you got the original loan you did n't have this outstanding debt on your credit report so there must be a reason why now you are getting better terms despite having this additional debt you did n't have before . It 's very possible and happens a lot , but I 'd say it 's well below 50 % of the time . But if the interest rates are comparable there really is n't any benefit to doing so , and the downside is that it hurts your credit in 2 ways ( it both adds another inquiry for the new loan , and it reduces your average account length ) Next , if the loan you are paying off is amortized such as a home or car loan , refinancing means you are starting the amortization schedule over which is never a good thing unless you are getting a significantly better interest rate or perhaps it 's only slightly better but you were n't very far into the schedule int he first place .","It depends on the loan and details of what your money is going to . If you had a $ 10,000 line of credit that was available to you , and were in 10k of credit card debt , then I do n't see why pulling 10k out of the line of credit to pay off the CC would be a bad idea . Credit cards tend to have very high interest that will just keep adding up if you do n't pay it down . Paying it all off instantly like that will stop that high interest . You then have no CC debt , but 10k on that ' loan ' to pay off at a lower interest rate . If you manage your finances better and do n't get into debt like that again you may be fine . In other cases , you may have some loans that are near the end and your payments are going more to the loan itself and less to interest .

Similarly , we do n't want to do it to bacteria because bacteria were brought up properly by their parents and always share- by which I mean that they can transfer their genes laterally to other species . Think C.Diff is bad ? Imagine if it develops a growth rate that 's twice as fast . Not good . What we * are * doing however , is looking into plants . Depending on when you last studied biology you may or may not know that there are many different types of photosynthesis . Most plants use C3 photosynthesis , which was a lot better back when there was more CO2 in the air and less oxygen , but is increasingly inefficient . Some plants use C4 photosynthesis , which works better in all sorts of ways . C4 plants use less water , grow faster , and generally need less fertiliser . Sugar cane is a crop that naturally uses C4 .

TL;DR , we 're trying to make plants grow faster and more efficiently as a way to give more food and take more CO2 out of the atmosphere Edit : a few follow up questions have been quite common ; - No this would not be a good solution to climate change , most of the CO2 taken up would be released by decomposition , however trees modified to C4 could help with reforestation efforts by growing quickly . C4 trees could possibly grow faster than C3 trees , and if the total amount of biomass increases as a result , then more CO2 will be sequestered . - There are many scenarios where C3 is better than C4 ; it tends to be better in cooler , wetter environments with lower oxygen levels . However as the climate warms up , C4 will be increasingly important . - No , growing algae in vats would not be a good solution . Any fuel generated would release this CO2 back into the environment . Yes , this would possibly reduce the amount of new CO2 being added to the atmosphere by preventing fossil fuels being burnt , at best this is carbon neutral , it does n't actively decrease the CO2 in the atmosphere . - A lot of people are upset by me using the figure of 25 % more efficiency for C4 plants . The fact is that around 25 % of all photosynthesis reactions in C3 plants go wrong , trying to fix O2 rather than CO2 , in a process called photorespiration .

You add a little fuel somewhere in the process , which ends up igniting either from a spark plug or from the high pressure and temperature environment in the cylinder . This causes the pressure and temperature to further skyrocket , and that can be harnessed by allowing the working fluid of air and exhaust to expand against a piston connected to a crankshaft . Then , you blow out the remaining exhaust particles , which take up space that you 'd rather fill with fresh air ( again , oxygen ) in the next engine cycle . Repeat that at high speeds , having typically 10 - 200 combustion events every second per cylinder in the case of a piston - cylinder engine , or having one long continuous event in the case of a turbine .","Your standard four - stroke engine runs as follows : stroke 1 : As the piston expands the chamber , fill it with a fuel / air mixture . stroke 2 : The piston compresses the chamber . A spark is lit just before the compression stroke completes . stroke 3 : The spark ignites the fuel , the explosion pushing the piston which is attached to a crankshaft , causing it to spin . stroke 4 : As the piston returns , the exhaust is pushed out from the chamber . This process repeats , keeping the crankshaft spinning which ultimately causes the wheels of your vehicle to spin .","Well , you have 2 main types of engines : diesel and conventional . I 'll explain each in turn . First of all , your conventional engine usually runs on a four step process . Step 1 : Intake . The engine pulls in a mixture of fuel and air , which pushes the cylinder to its maximum volume . Step 2 : Compression . The piston pushes the mixture to a predetermined pressure ( which will cause a bigger bang ) . Step 3 : Combustion . The spark plug at the top of the cylinder ignites the mixture , pushing down the piston , which creates the power needed to run your car . Step 4 : Exhaust .

Additional note : if you were to directly compare a Diesel engine to a conventional engine at the same exact temperature and pressure , the conventional would actually be more efficient .

{"question":"What makes Nuclear bombs so much more powerful than ' normal ' bombs ? How exactly is it possible such a relatively ' small ' bomb can create so much damage and why is the fall out so incredibly dangerous ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Bombs work by rapidly releasing energy , which in turn heats up the air / material around it and causes an explosion . Imagine a hill and a ball . The hill is a little bit special , it has a small groove at the top so that the ball can sit there stabily , but the grove is n't so deep that you ca n't push it over and down the hill . Now , there are a couple key states to note : The ball being at the top of the hill , and the ball being at the bottom of the hill . If the ball starts in either of those states , it kinda just sits there . However , if you decide to push the ball out of its groove and down the hill , it will have a lot of energy by the time it reaches the bottom of the hill , which will be released into whatever it hits . This is kind of how bombs work as well . Non - nuclear ( conventional ) bombs use chemical reactions ( reactions between atoms ) . The chemicals inside the bomb are capable of being in multiple states . By design , they are first in the high energy state ( ball on top of hill ) , before before being pushed into a low energy state ( ball bottom of hill ) . This transformation is from one set of chemicals to another set of chemicals , releasing lots of energy in the process . Nuclear bombs are pretty much the same , except instead of the changes of state happening between atoms , it happens within atoms . After an atom gets to about the size of an iron atom , it gets harder and harder to pack more protons and neutrons onto it ( it 's like pushing the ball up the hill ) , so when some manage to get knocked away , it releases energy . Pound per pound this actually releases A LOT of energy compared to chemical reactions , which is why nuclear weapons are so much stronger . As for nuclear fallout , it 's still pretty similar . Nuclear weapons release / create a lot of atoms that are unstable . They have a bad neutron / proton balance and are akin to a ball on the top of a hill with just a itty bitty groove , that is very easily knocked into releasing its energy ( technically , it does n't require a knock , just time ) . This release of energy can happen when the atom is a part of human cells , or can just pass through and knock some things around . This actually happens all the time because the world is filled with radiation , but too much of it can be hard for your body to handle , causing cancer and other issues .","Normal chemical reactions do n't affect the number and type of atoms present in a system . However , in larger atoms , the bonds the nucleus of an atom contain a significant amount of energy . A fission weapon attempts to exploit this by firing neutrons at a semi - stable atom ( like uranium 235 ) , creating an unstable product that splits into new atoms . These new atoms are also often unstable , but decay over longer times , giving rise to nuclear fallout .","There 's a force that keeps atoms bound together ( called the strong nuclear force ) . It 's powerful enough to overcome the electromagnetic forces that would otherwise push protons away from each other . When a nuclear warhead detonates , a number of the molecules are split , releasing the nuclear binding energy that was holding them together . Once one molecule does this , the flying particles hit others and cause them to do the same , resulting in a cascade of molecules splitting in a very short amount of time . All this energy results in a huge explosion . The fallout of a single nuke is n't incredibly dangerous if the bomb detonates in the air ( as the two used in WW2 were ) since the radioactive debris is blown away and dispersed by wind and water relatively quickly . However , should a nuke detonate at ground level , radioactive material will mix with dirt and settle , causing elevated levels of radiation in the area ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Nuclear bombs are much more powerful than normal bombs because they release a huge amount of energy when they explode. This energy comes from the nucleus, or center, of an atom. When the nucleus of an atom is split, or when two nuclei come together and fuse, a large amount of energy is released. This energy can be used to create a very powerful explosion.\\n\\nThe reason that nuclear bombs can create so much damage is because of the large amount of energy that they release. When a nuclear bomb explodes, it creates a shock wave that can knock down buildings, create huge craters, and cause other damage over a wide area.

If the earth is truly rotating , atmosphere and all , then the Foucault pendulum would n't be possible whatsoever , would it ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["The * Coriolis effect * happens when you 're on a rotating surface and you change your distance from the center of rotation . It 's easiest to explain if you think about standing on a merry - go - round . All the horses on the merry - go - round make one full rotation in the same amount of time . But the horses farther from the center have a longer distance to travel in that same amount of time . So they 're moving faster than the horses near the center . What if you try to jump from one horse to another ? If you 're on a horse near the center and you jump outwards , you 're jumping from a slower horse to a faster horse . As you jump outwards , you 're moving with the same speed as the slower horse was ( because of inertia ) , but suddenly you 're in a zone of faster horses . The horse you were trying to jump onto is moving faster than you are , so it outpaces you and you fall on the floor behind it . In other words , moving outwards from the center of rotation causes you to drift backwards , from the point of view of the rotating merry - go - round . The opposite happens if you jump from one of the outer horses inwards - you 're moving faster than the horse you 're aiming at , so you drift forwards . The same thing happens on Earth 's surface . The North and South Poles are at the axis of rotation , so they have no lateral speed . But the Equator is moving at over 1000 mph . So as you move from one of the Poles toward the Equator , you will drift \" backwards \" with respect to Earth 's rotation ( i.e. westward ) . If you 're moving from the Equator toward one of the Poles , you 'll drift \" forwards \" ( eastward ) . This affects any floating object to some extent .

Why then , are these tax systems still so popular all over the world ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Partly because other tax systems that target specific types of goods have the unintended consequence of causing people to * * shift to other goods that are n't taxed * * , causing them to miss out on what they really wanted * and * not generate the tax revenue that officials hoped . In economics , this is called [ deadweight loss . ] ( URL_2 ) To illustrate this , imagine that there 's a tax on * * red sports cars * * . Not sports cars , just * red * sports cars . Many people who love sports cars and want to get their sports car in the colour red are now just going to get blue instead . In those cases , the result is that the government does n't get the revenue from the red colour tax , * and * the guy who really wanted the red sports car has to settle for his second - favourite colour . * * Everyone is worse off . * * Now you might argue * \" Okay , but why not a tax on ALL sports cars ? \" * That 's better , but the result is inevitably somewhat the same , just pushed back a level : some people who really wanted a sports car but ca n't quite cough up the extra cash for the huge sports car tax will instead settle for non - sports - cars .

But surely * some * people will suck it up and pay the sports car tax ( or the * red * sports car tax ) regardless ? Well , yes , some undoubtedly will . But the point is that it 's still inefficient to * some * degree overall if it causes some number of people to shift to their sub - optimal preferences to avoid the tax , thus making everyone worse off . That 's why many economists favour broad taxes like the VAT or other general sales taxes that do n't discriminate between goods nearly as much . But it 's absolutely true that such broad taxes * * disproportionately hurt low - income people * * ( what economists call a [ regressive tax ] ( URL_0 ) ) , because low - income people spend a greater portion of their wealth and income on sales / VAT - taxable goods ( as opposed to rich people who would put it in , say , stocks or whatever . ) But that 's where redistribution comes in - the government gives money back to low - income people , whether in the form of tax rebates , lower income taxes for the poor , or something like the [ Earned - Income Tax Credit ] ( URL_1 ) .","Economist here , this is extremely untrue , VAT and GST are by far considered the best kind of tax to use as a country specifically because they ( in theory ) can avoid creating any market distortions , and do n't leave glaring gaps in your application . Yes this does lead to the tax not being progressive , but you do n't in any way want to use taxes to close your income equality issues as taxes inherently require you to only apply them to people who take part in specific financial transactions . Not everyone that needs government help participates in the transactions that can be taxed . What you want ideally is to have excise taxes like VAT only , and then use subsidies and direct payments to even out your income equality . Having progressive taxes means you have to determine who is poor and who is not based on the type of financial transactions they do , which immediately gets ridiculously inaccurate . That 's why we have to have income taxes filed as joint or married , have people claim a number of dependents , have people claim special deductions , etc etc etc . and even after all this differentiation we STILL ca n't accurately determine who is poor and who is n't , and that 's before you consider that people will change their habits in response to being taxed , which means even if you came up with a magic perfectly calibrated progressive tax today , by tomorrow it would be way off the mark as people shift their habits . Yet if we use only subsidies to make sure people are n't poor you can have a 100 % success rate by simply providing for the basic needs you want to all the people you have .

If there is a flat tax of 10 % on every purchase it 's unlikely to change consumption pattern significantly .

{"question":"What is net neutrality ? What is it ? I 've heard of it before but I do n't understand any of it . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Net neutrality is the concept that every internet service provider * ( ISP ) * treats every piece of data equally . This means that the ISP does n't slow packages down when they go to websites that are n't in their favor . This means that ISP A transfers the packages of its own customers just as reliably and just as fast as the packages coming from or going to ISP B. In a nutshell . Internet transfer is equal for everybody","Here 's a hypothetical example , using real - world players : Comcast is the biggest ISP in the country . More people get their internet through Comcast than any other company , and most of them do n't really have any alternatives . If they want to get online , they got ta go through Comcast . Comcast also wholly owns NBCUniversal ( as in NBC , MSNBC , Telemundo , and many other media channels ) , which also gives it a 30 % stake in Hulu . Essentially , in addition to owning the data network , Comcast also owns a lot of the media that their network carries to consumers . Now , * * in comes Netflix * * , who is * not * owned by Comcast . As an entertainment service , Netflix is a direct competitor to Hulu and many of Comcast 's other holdings , so Comcast would * much * prefer if people watched Hulu instead of Netflix . However , since Netflix * is n't * a massive ISP , they have to go through Comcast 's network if they want to get to most of their users . And this is where the problems start appearing . * * In a world * without * Net Neutrality * * , Comcast can manipulate its network in a way that basically fucks with people 's connection to Netflix and favors their connection to Hulu . They can slow the connection to the point where Netflix 's quality drops , load times are long , etc , you get the idea . Meanwhile , they can also make sure that Hulu always has a fast , crystal - clear connection , even if that means screwing over other connections when the bandwidth gets tight . Long story short , Comcast gets to use the fact that they own the infrastructure to unfairly undermine their competition . It 'd be like if Verizon * purposefully * gave you shitty call quality whenever you called somebody who used Sprint . However , * * in a world * with * Net Neutrality * * , Comcast * ca n't * discriminate between the services it provides a connection to . Legally , they have to treat Netflix , YouTube and everybody else in the same way that they treat Hulu . They do n't get to play favorites . Thus , you ( the consumer ) end up benefiting enormously , because you can pick whatever service you like the best and ca n't be forced into watching Hulu because Comcast wants you to . As you can see , * * Net Neutrality is good because it keeps the internet free from the manipulation of the people who run it , who do n't always have your best interests at heart . * * For comparison , phone carriers have been subjected to similar regulations for years ; they ca n't prioritize certain calls over others based on who 's calling who . Obviously , this has n't caused any huge problems for phone carriers , so the only reason why ISPs are fighting against similar laws for the internet is because they do n't want to lose the gravy train .","The internet is a giant crisscrossing networks of pipes transporting tiny packets of data . If you want something that is 100 kilobytes it 'll be spread out across hundreds of packets which will individually travel across the network in the most efficient route . However between your home and the beginning of the above mentioning quilt of the internet is the thread that connects you to it ( your ISP ) . Net - Neutrality dictates that an ISP has no right to change the speed or the route of your packet(s ) based on it 's destination . The easiest example is if Comcast ( Xfinity ) wanted to encourage their customers to use their OnDemand service for internet - TV they might degrade the quality of your Netflix connection in the hopes that you as a customer will say \" Man Netflix is always so * * slow * * , I should try Xfinity ! \" However this is inherently unfair to both Netflix and you as a customer . The ISP is directly impeding Netflix 's ability to run as a business and is denying you , as a customer , from making an informed decision . As a parallel to this imagine your local cities streets were contracted out to a private contractor . This contractor also owns a nearby Ford dealership . In order to boost sales he makes the road to all of the other dealerships incredibly bumpy and all of the road - signs are confusing and made it incredibly difficult to navigate . Some people will continue to make the journey because they * * really * * want a Chevy . But a lot of people will just throw their hands up in frustration and buy a Ford . The difference between this example and Net Neutrality is that roads are protected by the government as a public entity ( similar to a utility ) while right now the Internet is not protected ( and Trump is actively trying to revoke what little protections are in place ) . If you want another example , imagine your neighbor who is a really good person is trying to set up a local business to custom make a small widget that he sells online . However his local ISP also owns a business which mass - produces those widgets . In order to make it harder for your neighbor to compete he makes 50 % of the packets which go to his website fail to arrive . This causes potential customers to constantly drop their connection . Maybe some will persevere through it , but many would rather just go to the mass - produced company and buy them . This is * * not * * your neighbors fault and he is competing fairly , however he is being artificially blocked and being forced to fail . There is nothing your neighbor can do to protect himself except to pay a \" Special Fee \" to his local ISP for a \" Protected Connection \" . If he does this he can compete fairly , but the ISP still wins because although they may be losing potential ( stolen ) business , they are still making free money for NOT blocking his website .

Under a National Front presidency , Le Pen has stated that she will push for a referendum for France to leave the EU ( similar to Brexit ) . If France does leave the EU , the entire union will likely dissolve . The effects of this are largely unknown , but there are some certainties about what would happen in a post - EU world .

As an example the conflict about the territory in the south China sea . If the US comes with an ultimatum that China refuses and then start sending survey ships to the area .

{"question":"The Different Levels of Partner at a law Firm Been watching the good wife and iv herd named and equity partner thrown around alot . Is there a regular partner status ? How does this differ from an associate level position . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["This is gon na be an overly detailed answer because I 'm a lawyer at a big NYC law firm and currently want any excuse not to do my work . First , it 's important to note that in the United States law firms are a special type of business known as a partnership . This is in contrast to the business type known as a corporation . There are lots of technical and legal distinctions between the two involving how they are owned the liabilities that people who own them accrue but that 's not particularly important to the answer . Corporations are owned by shareholders and run by an executive . Technically speaking , none of those people are liable for the corporations debts only the corporation itself is . Partnerships are owned and usually run by , the same people . Furthermore , the partners are on the hook for the obligations of any of the other partners . There are lots of arguments for and against why people think this is the better way to organize lawyers but I 'll save that rant for another post . In short , an equity partner just means a regular partner . They are the people who own a portion of the firm . Technically an equity partner is an equal partner to any other equity partner in a firm and all decisions about the firm ( i.e. the partnership ) has to go through the partners . In practice , the exact power of any individual partner can vary because of a contract but that 's generally what an equity partner is . So in sum , they are the owners of the business and they get the profits . There can be junior equity partners who have significantly reduced rights or profits from a partnership . Sometimes these people may have such intensely reduced rights they may be partners in a very limited sense . These are usually what 's called junior partners . Usually they will share in the profit structure but to a much reduced degree . Some law firms call \" junior partners \" people who are just higher than associates but not actually partners . This has become more common in big law firms as a way to give people more power / money / position over associates but without bringing them truly into the partnership structure . My firm has this status but calls them something else . This is also what is known as a non - equity partner . They do n't share in the profit and are instead just paid a set salary . Associates are lawyers who do n't have an equity stake ( ownership ) in a firm but are supposedly on the track to becoming a partner at the firm . I say supposedly because at big law firms like on the good wife , 95 % of associates will not make partner . In a big law firm associate - ship follows a class model where you start as a first year and move up every year ( assuming there are n't outside circumstances ) . Each increase in year usually corresponds with a raise and a greater amount of responsibility . Some firms have people who have forever associates . Lastly , there are staff attorneys . Staff attorneys usually have similar responsibility levels to low and mid - level associates but there is no pretensions about ever making them a partner . This is of course somewhat limited to the big firm structure . Smaller firms may do things slightly differently ( they have much less regimented rules for what it means to be an associate for example ) . Hope that helps ! I 'm happy to answer any more questions if it keeps me from my work ! :)","At a very simple level ( it gets more complicated the larger the firm is , and the more personalities they 're trying to wrangle ) , you get a basic breakdown of ' lawyers ' : * Associate : a line - level legal person at the firm . Has passed the bar , but is still learning the trade ( or works under a Partner ) * Senior Associate : someone who has the basics under their belt and is beginning to build their own practice . They likely have a specialty or two , and are doing similar quality work to a Partner . They get paid based on their work , like an associate . * Partner : Someone who has a stake in the firm . They 're expected to bring in business or contribute a lot to the firm . They get paid based on what the firm makes in the year instead of a fixed salary ( though there may be a base salary too ) . * Equity / managing Partner : Someone who has ' bought into ' the firm or is at a high level . At smaller firms , these are the people with their name on the building / firm . They likely put in money to get everything started , or ' own ' a portion of the business . If not , they are above most of the other partners and/or bring in a giant amount of business . They get paid based on what the firm makes , with a bigger cut of the pie than a base Partner . Depending on the firm , these levels can be broken up into multiple pieces , but it 's a decent high - level overview .","Equity partner means you 've been asked to become an owner of the firm . You buy equity in the firm , and get a portion of firm profits in addition to base salary . You also get some say in how the firm is run / managed . Managing partner(s ) is / are the partner(s ) who is / are chosen to run the firm , effectively the CEO or board of the firm . Name partner is be whose name is literally part of the law firm , like Diane Lockhart and Will Gardner of Lockhart Gardner . It 's typically very rare to add named partners ... names are typically founders , even long after they 've retired / died . What 's more common is to add names when two firms merge , combining named partners of each firm ( but sometimes some get dropped off ) ."],"chatgpt_answers":["In a law firm, a partner is a lawyer who is a member of the firm and shares in its profits.

{"question":"What makes objects transparent or translucent ? Because in my mind it makes no sense that something hard like a diamond or bullet proof glass let the light in , but squishy and soft stuff like play doh or paint , can effectively block the light . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Photons are very small , and they can pass between atoms . Things are transparent when the arrangement of atoms in the material lets photons through without absorbing them , and opaque when the photons are absorbed . Note that a material can be transparent to some light frequencies ( colors ) and opaque to others . Glass blocks some ultraviolet , for example ; visible light passes through the glass , but ultraviolet photons have just the right amount of built - in energy to interact really well with the Silicon Oxide molecules in the glass , and they get absorbed . Your skin and organs are transparent to x - rays , but metals and your bones are not . A material 's properties ( hardness , softness , squishiness ) are determined by the arrangement of atoms or molecules in it . Most things that are hard , like diamonds or steel , have a structure where the atoms or molecules form hexagons or cubes or some similar structure where each atom attracts the atoms around it and the material is hard . Materials that are soft or rubbery , on the other hand , have very weak ( chemical ) connections between the molecules inside . In any case , how light interacts with the material ( for transparency ) is not quite the same as the arrangement of molecules in the material or the attraction forces between them .","The previous response talked about the arrangement of atoms but this is not the reason that some things are transparent to visible light . The wavelength of visible light is many hundreds of times bigger than atoms so it is almost impossible for light to travel through a material without interacting , the actual explanation is more complex . For when UV and visible light encounter an object it will interact with the valence electrons of the atoms in a number of different ways depending on the wavelength of light and the type of atom ( The difference due to wavelength is why some things can be transparent to some colours but not others ) When the light interacts with the electron there are 2 options that are important here , either it is absorbed and then scattered which will cause the object to be opaque to this wavelength , or the electrons are unable to absorb it and it continues on its path without interacting causing the material to be transparent to it","There 's a number of misinformed answers here . Whether or not light is absorbed by a solid has to do with the electrons of its atoms . Electrons can absorb energy , but only a specific amount of energy : no more or less . What energies are allowed to be absorbed are different depending on what kind of atom it is or what other atoms its bonded with . Now photons of light carry energy . That energy is determined by the wavelength of light . Red light , green light , ultraviolet , x - rays , etc . all have different amounts of energy . If that light attempts to pass through a substance , in order to be absorbed , there must be electrons that are allowed to absorb the exact amount of energy that the light has . If not , then it passes through the substance . Dr. Moriarty from Sixty Symbols does a [ video ] ( URL_0 ) on this that 's pretty good ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Transparency is the property of a material that allows light to pass through it. When light hits an object, it can either be absorbed by the object, reflected off the object, or transmitted through the object. Transparent materials allow most of the light to pass through them, so they appear clear. Translucent materials allow some light to pass through them, but they also scatter the light, so they appear cloudy or hazy.\\n\\nThe reason that some hard materials like diamonds and bulletproof glass can be transparent is because they are made up of tiny crystals or molecules that are arranged in such a way that allows light to pass through them. Soft materials like playdough or paint are not transparent because they are made up of larger molecules that are not arranged in a way that allows light to pass through easily. Instead, the light is absorbed or scattered by the material, making it appear opaque.\\n\\nSo, the main difference between transparent and opaque materials is the way that their molecules are arranged and the size of their molecules.

Water is n't the only thing that cells need though , they also need sugars and salt . If you drink seawater , your cells will absorb it but soon be at a very high salt level . This causes them to not absorb more water , causing you to get dehydrated . I 'm not exactly sure what it is in coffee that stops this though . The reverse effect can sort of happen when you drink distilled water . This is water without any salts or calcium in it . If you drink it , your cells will keep absorbing more and more water because they need the salts from the water . But since the distilled water does n't have any , the cells will eventually burst !","Coffee has a lot of caffeine in it , caffeine is a diuretic . Think about it like having diarrhea , your body thinks there 's a problem and uses a tonne of water to expel that problem . So you end up getting rid of far more water than goes into your system .

So the benefit of pickling is you can take food , put it in a jar that you rinsed the dirt out of and put a top on it to keep the bugs out . You only need to do a moderate job at sealing it , and you have no requirements to sterilize it . The food will keep for years in this condition . Not even a fire is needed to prepare the food . No fancy canning equipment is required either .","Many kinds of bacteria and other pathogens have difficulty surviving in the acidic , oxygenless environment of the pickling process . In addition , some kinds of bacteria that * do * thrive in such conditions are harmless and in fact improve the taste via fermentation , while also shooing away other bacteria that could potentially survive in such conditions that could potentially be harmful .","Well back before refrigeration , you needed a way to keep food edible for long periods of time ( winter ) .

The jar is then sealed and left to sit for a period of time, typically a few weeks to a few months.

{"question":"Trickle down economics Can someone explain the theory behind trickle down economics ? what are the benefits and drawbacks of trickle down economics ? And does it actually work ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["The theory Trickle Down ( also called Supply Side ) behind it ? Sure . On paper it makes sense . The wealthy buy big ticket items such as cars , planes , boats , etc . This creates demand and people are employed to create these products . They then use that payment to pay mortgages , cable bill , new shoes , etc . Or the rich start businesses . Employing many people who receive a wage so they can in turn provide for themselves and others . Or the rich invest in stocks . Which gives businesses capital . Allowing them to expand , hire , etc etc . And while this does happen , it 's never in a large enough quantities to affect the economy like the creators envisioned . Most just horde the money in real estate or money market accounts . It works on paper , and its a good theory , but it does n't work in reality . Keynesian Economics ( also called Demand Side ) has consistently proven to be a more effective method of jump starting an economy .","Let 's say the government ( who collects a lot of taxes , and has a lot of money to spend ) decides to give you , Joe Taxpayer , $ 50 a month to spend on food . ( well , you and let 's say , 99 other taxpayers in your town ) You and the other 99 go to the grocery store , buy more food , which helps the grocery store pay it 's bills , including wages for its employees and buying groceries from suppliers . Some of that $ 5000 goes to the employees , some go to the farmers and bakers and suppliers , and some goes to the grocery store owner . The employees have a little more money so they can buy more things for themselves . The farmers and bakers and whatnot have more money , so they grow more crops and bake more bread to sell to those employees who have more money . This is a really simple version of \" demand - side \" economics , and the idea was originally expressed by a guy named Keynes . More money to people means more spending , means more demand , and the economy grows . Trickle - down economics looks at the other side of the equation . It suggests we should give $ 5000 to * the grocery store owner * . With that extra money , the owner can afford to expand the store . Maybe he decides the store can be open for a few more hours a day , and needs to hire more people to cover those hours . Maybe he decides to buy more groceries to get a discount , and lowers his prices . Maybe he just decides to give his employees raises , so they 're more motivated and productive on the job . Basically , he can use the money to grow his business , or make his business more efficient so his employees or his customers ( or both ) get a benefit . The theory behind trickle - down economics comes in large part from something that happened in the 1970 's . For a long time , our government used demand - side economics , like in the first example . Demand - side economics has a known drawback : by increasing demand and having more money in circulation , you create inflation . You can fight inflation by having less money in circulation , but that leads to higher unemployment rates . For a very long time , this was believed to be an absolute truth of economics : if inflation was high , unemployment was low , and vice - versa . But when the oil crisis and the price shocks happened in the 70 's , something unexpected happened : inflation went way up , * * and * * the unemployment rate went up . This happened because the * supply - side * of the economic decreased , something that really had n't happened in a very long time before or since . But it got some people thinking : if its possible to shrink the * supply * and create high inflation * * and * * high unemployment , then should n't it be possible to grow the supply - side , getting both low inflation and low unemployment ? The answer to that turns out to be \" it might be possible in theory , but in the real world , no we ca n't reliably grow the Supply part of the economy the way we can consistently stimulate the Demand part of the economy \" .","Here 's what I posted a few hours ago when somebody asked about Reaganomics ... Reagan popularized the idea of \" trickle down \" economics ... the idea that cutting taxes for the rich would cause them to spend more , invest more , and result in creating jobs for others . 40 years on , and the rich have gotten way richer while the lower and middle classes have not benefited in the ways the theory suggested . This is why the income gap has grown over the past 3 - 4 decades rather than closed . The reality is that the rich have less marginal demand and that they do n't invest money when there is n't demand to justify investment . A tax cut does n't necessarily mean they 'll buy more cars or homes or restaurant meals . They wo n't hire workers or build a factory just because they paid less in taxes , if the business itself does n't have demand for its good or services to justify the investment in more people or equipment . Sure , some of that money might get spent or invested , but not immediately and not all of it . Meanwhile , more money in the hands of lower income workers would very likely get spent quickly . There is pent up demand for new cars , better housing , newer clothing , furniture , more meals out , etc . from those with limited means . This increased demand would boost businesses and then promote investment in growing the businesses to meet rising demand .

","human_answers":["Let 's say you have a point that emits light in all directions . The amount it gives off is constant . After the light has gone a certain distance , it covers a sphere with a certain radius . But the total amount of light going through it is still the same as all of the light emitted by the point . If you go even further , this sphere is ven larger . And the total amount of light is still constant . But you ca n't use an entire sphere to light something up . Instead , only part of it hits your targtet . Let 's say this target has an area of 1 of your favourite units of area . If you put this area in the path of the light , only a fraction of all of he source 's light will hit it . It 's the part of he sphere that your area overlaps .

The Inverse Square Law is a principle that explains how light behaves over distance. When you take a picture with a camera, the light from the subject you're photographing travels through the air and enters the camera lens. If you're close to the subject, the light is very bright and the picture will be well-lit. But if you move further away from the subject, the light becomes dimmer and the picture will be darker.\\n\\nThe Inverse Square Law says that the amount of light decreases in an inverse relationship to the square of the distance from the light source. In other words, if you double the distance between the light and the subject, the light will become four times dimmer. If you triple the distance, the light will become nine times dimmer, and so on.\\n\\nThis is important in photography because it helps photographers understand how to control the amount of light in their pictures. By understanding the Inverse Square Law, photographers can use different techniques, such as moving closer to or farther away from the subject, using a flash, or adjusting the aperture of the camera, to get the right amount of light in their pictures."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Sure, I'll do my best! \n\nSo, have you ever tried playing \"catch\" with a ball with someone while standing really far away?

Details : What is smoke ? It 's soot , and carbon compounds , tar , aerosols , un burned fuel , and other components of incomplete combustion . When a fire burns brightly and hotly , it efficiently combines oxygen with carbon to make carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide , and with hydrogen to make water vapor . If all of the hydrocarbons and organic material being burned are done so cleanly , then there is very little smoke and instead an almost pure reaction resulting in carbon dioxide and water which are odorless and transparent gases . IE not smoke . When a flame is extinguished but there is still a lot of latent heat , the process of burning is snuffed out resulting in incomplete transformation into the water and carbon dioxide , leading to incomplete compounds which create the soot .","Smoke is fine particulate matter suspended in a gaseous stream . Air currents can stir up these fine particles just as easily as outgassing from a fire . Every drop of water stirs it up . Fire requires 3 pieces to exist : heat , oxygen , & fuel .

{"question":"How can something be \" more hydrating \" than water ? I was under the impression that hydrating is just talking in water , so how can some drinks supposedly let your body take in more than just pure water ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["There 's no concept of ' more hydrating ' . Why ? Because hydrating means provide your body with water , and it happens either way whether you 're drinking bottled water , sea water or even piss . It 's just marketing language . However , sports drinks come in various electrolyte concentrations that can help your body depending on when you want to drink : * hypotonic drinks have a lower electrolyte concentration than your blood . Since the electrolyte concentration in the cells is higher than the blood / sports drink and water always flows to the compartment with the highest salt concentration ( osmosis ) , the water goes into the cells and the body is most efficiently hydrated . Hypotonic drinks work the best before an event . * isotonic drinks have the same electrolyte concentration as the blood , which is ideal during / after exercise . You want to replace the fluids / electrolytes that you 've lost by sweating . Most of the time isotonic drinks also contain carbohydrates to provide the body some extra fuel and absorb the electrolytes more efficiently ( electrolyte / water transport channels in the small intestine work better in presence of glucose ) . * hypertonic drinks contain high glucose / high electrolytes(/protein ) . The goal is n't necessarily rehydrating the body , but replenish glycogen stores ( a form of glucose stores in muscle tissue ) and electrolyte levels . Works best after an intense workout . Source : am recently graduated physiologist looking for a job * * edit * * I got some flak for my explanations not being 100 % correct , which is true . When explaining the human body as simplistic as possible you ca n't have anything right , people forget it 's an ELI5 and sometimes you have to leave certain parts out in order to make the subject comprehensive for someone who does n't know much about the human body . If you want an explanation that covers everything I suggest you should post a question over at r / askscience or r / physiology . There are simply too many different systems in the body that interact / counteract with each other depending how healthy the body is and/or the state of the body during rest / exercise . But I 'll try to adress the most common responses here ( still in ELI5 ) . Sorry for formatting or spelling , I 'm on mobile . Also , English is my third language . * is Gatorade / Powerade / G - Fuel hypo- , iso- , or hypertonic ? It depends what kind of drink you buy , each brand has specialized sports drinks series designed for your type of exercise and preferred moment of hydration in the flavor that you like . By the way , tonicity refers to the sodium concentration in the beverage , not the glucose content . * dehydration vs. hypovolemia vs. hypernatremia . Dehydration is when the total body water ( cells , blood , spaces between cells ) is less than normal . Hypovolemia is when the blood volume is less than normal ( about 5L ) . Hypernatremia is when the salt concentration in the blood is higher than normal . Some simple examples : you just donated blood ? Hypovolemia . Exercised for a long period in the heat without drinking ? Dehydration and possible hypernatremia . Did you drink a 2 liters of sea water ? Hypernatremia and hypervolemia . They all trigger thirst response , but the underlying mechanisms are different . Make sure you drink 1.5 - 2 liters of water per day to keep your body hydrated and filter out unwanted chemicals whether you 're exercising or not regardless of outside temperatures . Do n't chug it all in once but drink it throughout the day . If you 're thirsty , it 's already too late . Check your pee : if it 's clear , you 're good to go . * point of hypotonic beverages ( and water ) . The premise is that the hypotonic water flows into the cells , plus you 're overfilling your cardiovascular system . When exercising , water leaves the blood compartment first due to sweating before ' using ' the water that in in the cells . This acts like a sort of buffer before you feel the effects of hypernatremia . That 's the marketing part , but you could drink water as well . You do n't have to go to the store to buy this stuff and it 's saves you money . * But you 're overfilling the system ! Do n't the kidneys filter excess water out of the system ? * Yes they do . The primary jobs of the kidneys are regulating blood pressure and sodium content , filtering metabolites out of the blood etc . First response is : ' Fuck ! Sodium concentration is too low , too much water and the blood pressure is too high ! ' What happens is that the kidneys excrete water , but do n't * * re**absorb while retaining electrolyes . Result : pissing . But not during exercise . During exercise the sympathetic nervous system activity is elevated ( responsible for fight / flight ) , causing the activation of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system ( RAAS ) . This cascade is designed to prevent blood pressure from dropping too low by releasing agents in the blood stream that cause the arteries to constrict and the kidneys to recollect more water that already has been excreted . An example of the power this system can be found in people with heart failure and hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , where the sympathetic nervous system is overactive all the time , and the RAAS as well . * But how can you properly exercise when all the arteries are constricted ? Should n't the arteries to the exercising muscles stay open to provide blood ? * Yes they do , it 's a process called functional sympatholysis and is a phenomenon where the local environment overrides the sympathetic signals coming from the body . This enables the main arteries to the exercising muscles to dilate under influence of local nitric oxide ( NO ) release . * best cure for a hangover ? There is no cure , only prevention . Alternate between water and your preferred alcoholic beverage of choice as much as possible . Alcohol counteracts the effect of arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) in the kidneys , also known as anti - diuretic hormone ( ADH ) , which makes you pee more than you drink . Drink 1 - 2 glasses of water before you go to sleep . Do n't expect miracles the next morning but the headache should be a bit more bearable . * better explanation of the point of adding glucose and sodium to drinks . When you 're healthy , it does n't matter how you ingest sodium , glucose and water . The body is capable of transporting sodium ions through the intestinal border , causing water to follow it . But drinking tap water or water without added electrolytes also works well . Another way to get water into the body is the so called GLUT transporter . It is a protein that transports glucose and sodium from the gut into the body , causing the water to follow . This protein never fails and is one of the reasons why sports drinks also contain glucose , in addition to flavor and provide a bit of extra energy . For diarrhea , IV rehydration works the best but an oral rehydration solution is the next best alternative . It 's super rich in electrolytes and glucose , and if you do n't have it in your arsenal when you 're sick you can make one yourself as well . Sports drinks also help as a last resort but they do n't have the stopping power that ORS has . If you want to know more about this topic , u / Dex2Dex can provide a more detailed answer down below .","No no . All of these posts are missing the main reason why glucose and sodium are added to rehydrating drinks . Its not just about osmotic gradients . It 's about glucose and sodium channels being coupled with the gates that allow water absorption in your GI tract . ( By coupled I mean triggering one will trigger the other . ) If you want to maximize absorption of water after whatever balance your body thinks it has achieved you facilitate the process by adding glucose and sodium to activate these coupled transport gates . That is why WHO rehydration packs have these additives ... otherwise if it was purely about osmotic gradients you would nt need glucose , only salt .","Drinks like gatorade contain electrolytes which are basically salts , which help your body absorb the water you put into it faster . That s why salt makes you thirsty . So those drinks are nt giving you any more hydratiom than water , but simply allowing the water you take it to hydrate your more efficiently . Usually sports drinks are intended to be consumed along with additional water to better support an active body ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Water is a great way to hydrate your body, but sometimes people need to replace other substances that they lose in addition to water.

Both drinks contain a mix of carbonated water, sugar, and flavorings, including caffeine. However, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have slightly different recipes, and many people prefer one over the other because of the way the drinks taste.\\n\\nOne reason that Coca-Cola may be more popular is that it has been around for longer than Pepsi. Coca-Cola was invented in 1886, while Pepsi was invented in 1893. This means that Coca-Cola has had more time to become well-known and establish itself as a household name.\\n\\nAnother reason is that Coca-Cola has a stronger brand identity. Coca-Cola has always had a very clear and consistent brand image, with its iconic red and white color scheme and its distinctive cursive logo. This strong brand image has helped Coca-Cola stand out from other soft drinks and make it more recognizable to people around the world.\\n\\nUltimately, the reason why one person might prefer Coca-Cola over Pepsi, or vice versa, is a matter of personal preference.

{"question":"Do heat - seeking missiles ever accidentally lock onto the sun ? I do n't know how they exactly work - but do they recognize the sun as a hot object ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Usually , a heat - seeking missile has been programmed to change its trajectory based on various things , and so it can usually tell if it 's detecting the sun ( or , for example , infrared light from the sun scattered off of clouds ) or if it 's detecting its actual intended target . Compared to a person or a vehicle , the sun outputs a very obvious signal in infrared , since it 's pretty much always going to be the same level of infrared light and in the same shape , provided it is n't getting partially obscured by things . If a missile simply ignores the brightest source of infrared light ( or , if it 's searching for super - heated jet engine outputs , ignores anything less bright than that ) if it appears to be the size and intensity of the sun , it would n't be tricked by the sun . Of course , it is n't always going to be perfect , and there are conditions where the missile will mistake various things for its target - clouds , heat from sandy ground , and so on . Better and better technology and imaging techniques helps to mitigate this . The most sophisticated heat - seeking missiles basically make an infrared image of the surroundings and analyze it . Of course , even that is n't going to be perfect , yet . That 's why we use \" identify the pictures that have signs in them ! \" as ways to prove you 're not a robot - computers are pretty bad at correctly interpreting visual data .","Yes , this is actually a known problem with primitive heat - seeking missiles , and pilots would occasionally try to get between the missile and the sun in order to transfer the missile 's focus onto the sun .

This only works with IR missiles but it 's not likely too I happen in modern times due to the much larger range of Radar guided missiles . EDIT : heat seeking missiles are actually IR missiles that lock onto IR signatures and not heat ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Heat-seeking missiles, also known as infrared homing missiles, are designed to detect and follow the heat emitted by a target, such as an aircraft or vehicle. These missiles use a passive infrared seeker, which means that they do not emit any energy of their own and rely on detecting the heat emitted by the target.\\n\\nThe missile uses a sensor to detect the infrared radiation, or heat, coming from the target. The sensor is typically located in the nose of the missile, and it is able to pick up on the differences in temperature between the target and its surroundings. The missile then uses this information to guide itself towards the target.\\n\\nHeat-seeking missiles are able to recognize the sun as a hot object because it is a very bright and hot source of infrared radiation. However, the sun is so bright and hot that it can sometimes cause problems for the missile's seeker. If the missile is pointed directly at the sun, the sensor may become overwhelmed and unable to pick up on the heat signature of the intended target. In this case, the missile may lose its lock on the target and fail to hit it.\\n\\nOverall, heat-seeking missiles are designed to detect and follow the heat emitted by a target, and they are able to recognize the sun as a hot object.

{"question":"What is the whole point of calculus and how would you explain it to a five year old ? Like really I wanna know .. I 've been struggling with understanding it .. Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Math teacher here . While the previous comments explain aspects of calculus , the main point of calculus is to study change . The change of a \" curvy thing \" is n't always a \" straight thing \" it can actually also be a \" curvy thing . \" The rainbow idea is a great example of an integral , but again only one aspect of what an integral can do . That being said , basic calculus can be split into two ideas : derivatives and integrals . Derivatives find the rate of change of the rate of change . Sometimes we use the word slope to describe rate of change . A derivative will tell you the rate at which the rate changes . For example , if given a function of the speed of an object , the derivative would tell you how fast your speed is increasing or decreasing . The second derivative tells you how fast the fastness of the increasing or decreasing speed is increasing or decreasing . You can go on and on , but it tells you , more or less , how change changes . Integrals can be thought of as the inverse or opposite of a derivative . If given the derivative of a function , the integral would give you ( more or less , but the difference is basically inconsequential ) the original function . It also does something interesting , it tells us the accumulation of a function . So if a function describes , say , how much concrete is being poured on to a sidewalk at any given moment , the integral of this function would tell you how much concrete has accumulated , or the total amount of concrete poured out at any moment . Many people mistakenly think that an integral only measures the area under a curve . While the integral does measure the area under the curve , it really tells us the accumulation of a function . Of course , calculus does much much more , but this is a basic explanation of the basics of calculus","Hard to ELI5 , and I 'm probably not at all qualified but here goes . Say we have a rainbow , and we want to know much sky is under the rainbow . We split the sky under the rainbow into little rectangles , which gets us an idea . If we make each slice smaller and smaller , we get closer and closer to the real answer - but we ca n't actually get it perfect , as we 'll be leaving little bits of sky out of our rectangles right where they meet the rainbow . Obviously we ca n't have rectangles that do n't have any width , that would just be a line - and a line would n't contain any sky at all . So calculus lets us figure out what answer we approach as we get smaller and smaller slices . Again I 'm really not qualified to answer this , but that 's the basic idea . I 'm sure someone else will do better , and I look forward to reading it too .","Calculus is about approximating curvy things with straight things . It 's hard to find the area of a weird blob , but it 's easy to find the area of a square , so we try to measure blobs by seeing how many squares we can put inside of them .

URL_0","This turns out to be a surprisingly hard question and it has been solved in different ways in different groups of animals . You asked about humans so we have the best understanding from studies of other mammals ( rodents , rabbits mostly ) . In the early developing embryo , a small pit or node was observed by earlier developmental biologists . Some of the earliest ( and most informative ) experiments were to simply poke at the embryo or damage parts of it and see what would happen . This allowed people to conclude that this node was somehow responsible for establishing the left right axes of the early embryo , but how ? It turns out that this node is a little dish formed of cells with rotating filaments or cilia sticking out of their surface . Here is where it gets really cool . The cilia all turn clockwise but they are not just swinging around horizontally ( like you swinging around a weight on the end of a rope ) . The cilia are swinging at an angle ( as though you were swinging that rope around but tilted so that it was closer to the ground in front of you and higher up on the backside of the swing . ) The result of this is that on the lower part of the rotation , the cilia are close to the surface and experience some drag , but on the top side of the swing they are moving freely in the fluid and the fluid is pushed to that side . Small lipid - protein particles with signalling molecules are pushed to that one side where they accumulate and signal \" leftness \" to the underlying cells of the node . To me the amazing thing is that this information emerges from the simple physics of the system . As long as cells know front and back , they will all share this tilt and the direction of rotation is established by the structure of the cilia motor proteins .

So, when an embryo is first developing, it starts out as a single cell that divides and divides and divides again, forming many cells. These cells eventually start to specialize and form different parts of the body. At this stage, the embryo is symmetrical, meaning that both sides of the body look the same.\\n\\nHowever, as the embryo continues to develop, it starts to become asymmetrical. This means that one side of the body starts to look different from the other side. For example, the heart and liver form on one side of the body and not the other.\\n\\nThere are a few reasons why the body becomes asymmetrical. One reason is because certain genes are turned on or off in different parts of the embryo. These genes help to control how the cells in the embryo develop and what they become.\\n\\nAnother reason is because of the way that the cells in the embryo move around. As the cells divide and grow, they can push and pull on each other, causing the embryo to become asymmetrical.\\n\\nSo, while it is possible for an embryo to start out symmetrical, it eventually becomes asymmetrical as it grows and develops. And this is normal and healthy! In fact, having a body that is asymmetrical helps us to be able to do things like walk, run, and move around in different ways."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, you see, as the embryo grows and develops, certain organs and structures begin to form and take their place in the body.

Mirrored people could potentially function fine if all of their organs and structures were reversed, but that's not how human development almost ever works out."}

The sugar we use to make chocolate is often derived from \" sugar cane \" , which is a distant relative of grass . This sugar is chemically different from the sugars we get from honey .

{"question":"How does an EMP work ? How does an EMP knock out electronics ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Electricity , magnetism , and electromagnetic waves are all intimately related . Generally if you have one then you can produce either of the others , given the right arrangement and motion of your components . For example , a coiled wire with electric current running through it will become an electromagnet , a spinning magnet can be used in a generator to make electricity flow , and an antenna can convert absorbed radio waves ( a kind of EM wave ) into a bit of electricity . Generally when you look at antennas you 're looking at incredibly small amounts of electricity created from the absorbed radio waves . The radio waves are pretty low power and the receiver is very sensitive , while the antenna is typically designed to be sensitive mostly just to a small sliver of the radio spectrum . With an EMP you get such a strong burst of radio waves ( and other EM radiation ) that practically anything can be an antenna -- wires in devices , even the bits of metal on circuit boards that carry signals from one chip to another ( called \" traces \" ) . If it 's conductive then it 'll convert some of that radio wave into electricity . This can have two effects . The first is that if that wire was carrying a signal then it 's likely that the real signal will be overridden by the noise of the EMP . Many signals are robust against some level of noise and dropout like this , but few systems can operate with everything going wrong at once . Often a device will recover from this effect , although any persistent memory could have its contents erased or randomized leaving the device effectively unusable . The other effect is more destructive : the electrical energy has to go somewhere , and that somewhere is more often than not heat . The amount of heat that devices can take is limited , especially on the very , very small scale . If too much electric current is induced in just the wrong place then a component can fail , and if that component was important then the device may be rendered completely inoperable .","Nice try Kim Jong - un . Get your science knowledge elsewhere . And my countrymen wo n't spill the beans either .","So when you use a nuclear bomb ( not the only type of EMP theoretically , but the most discussed one ) you want to do the most damage . When you detonate them at a few hundred meters over the ground , they will have the ideal shockwave and fireball to destroy buildings etc . Still , this radius is limited by a few miles and does nt scale well with the energy yield of the bomb . Most of the energy / radiation will just get absorbed by the ground . Instead you can detonate them at high altitude . They wo nt knock over any buildings , but their radiation can travel freely through the atmosphere and bath an area of dozens of miles in radiation . This radiation is ionizing , that means it knocks electrons off of their atoms . In metals they can move freely to begin with and the radiation will cause them to flow in a certain direction and induce an electric current . All modern electronic devices are relying on transistors to amplify and switch signals . These things have a failure point where they will just fry if the electric current applied to them is too big . ( You could destroy a shitty amplifier if you somehow turned the volume up enough ) . So you can put an NEMP , a nuclear bomb , over an area and destroy all electronic equipment that is n't properly shielded or laid out for high currents ( interestingly , an old tube radio would be just fine ) . When you place the bomb at the right height the atmosphere and magnetic field of the earth can help you maximize the radiation on the ground"],"chatgpt_answers":["An EMP, or electromagnetic pulse, is a burst of electromagnetic radiation. It can be caused by a variety of things, such as a nuclear explosion or a solar flare. When an EMP occurs, it can produce a strong electric field and a magnetic field.

The Conservative & Unionist Party is their full current name and they are the current Government in both the Lords and the Commons , the Government in the Lords is n't important . They are also the Second Party in Y Senedd ( Welsh Parliament ) and Scots Parlaiment . The Conservative Party was formed in 1834 , following an awful election ressult for the Tories in 1832 . The Tories were the right wing party from 1678 - 1832 . Tory is a term used to describe a Conservative in the UK , it can be both used as an insult and a positive gesture . A specific insult with Tory is Red Tory , in the UK red is the Socialist colour and used by the Labour Party . Red Tory reffers to a Labour member who is to the right of the Labour Party , such as their former leader and Prime Minister Tony Blair , the only living Labour leader to win an election . The Conservatives are a large right wing party with many factions it is however right wing . The Tories believe in smaller government and lower taxes , however May ( current leader ) may try to increase several taxes , she has been iffy on the matter .

Labour believe in high tax high spend policies , Labour have currently suggested borowing £ 500 Billion to invest in the UK . Labour are too far too the left for a comparison to the US for the most part , the right of the Labour Party is similar to the left of the Democrats . The Labour Party is currently in a fairly open civil war . A coup in 2016 showed that 40/229 MPs backed Corbyn . Corbyn has massively increased membership in Labour and has got the Hard Left in control of Labour for the first time in a long time . Often the hard left fringe parties try to take over labour . As a damning fact the Communist Party are n't standing in any seat for the first time and are backing Labour . Labour have an arangement with the Social Labour Democratic Party meaning Labour does n't stand in Northern Ireland and the SDLP do n't stand in Great Britian . Labour have an arangement with the Co - Op Party meaning a Labour member can stand as Labour or Labour & Co - Op . * * * * We have other parties too ; The Liberal Democrats .

","human_answers":["When we talk about AI , this means all the attempts we 've made to make a program or robot act or think like we do . # 1 . Basic AI : rule based system For example , you can write a program to pretend to be a therapist ( \" Everybody hates me \" / \" Why do you say that everybody hates you ? \" ) . This would be a tedious task . You would have to write lots of hand written rules . It 's not rocket science , but it is still AI . However your program did n't learn the rules itself . You gave it the rules . This is a type of AI called a * rule based system * . # 2 . A bit smarter : machine learning but not deep learning The next step up is a type of AI where the bot will learn the rules . For example you could give it lots of example interactions between therapists and patients and define the kind of patterns that govern them and how complex you want your program to learn . You will also tell the program some useful hints : for example English is divided into words which are separated by spaces , it 's read left to right , and has nouns , verbs and adjectives , and the therapist is normally responding to the last thing the patient said . You define a score and say to the program , \" refine the rules until you 've got 90 % accuracy \" . This is a more advanced type of AI and it 's called * machine learning * . # 3 . Really smart : deep learning Now imagine you do n't tell your program anything about English grammar . You give it very few hints as to how to communicate in English . Maybe you do n't even tell it that spaces separate words . You define a very broad kind of program that could be thrown at any conversational task such as interactions with therapists garage mechanics in Japan or analysing financial news in German . You would just convert the patient 's words into numbers and propagate the numbers through a repeated process of multiplying and adding with some extra numbers called parameters , and then convert back into text , which will be the therapist 's answer . You just do n't specify what the parameters are that you 're multiplying and adding . Your program will pick the parameters that make it reproduce outputs most like the real therapists 's utterances you have recorded . This is the current state of the art in machine learning and it 's called * deep learning * and the set of parameters the program picks is called a * neural network * . What I just described can give really impressive results especially for making robots communicate with humans , or identify objects that they see .

Is this really intelligence ? # 4 .... True AI ? So a neural network is a type of machine learning . Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence . Artificial intelligence that does n't use machine learning would normally be using hand coded rules ( a rule based system ) . Have you ever used Microsoft Excel and fitted a line to a scatter graph ? For example if you plot the height and weight of all the people in your class or work , you can get Excel to draw a line through it . How did Excel find the line ? By picking two numbers , m and c , to make a formula y = mx + c. It picked m and c so that the distance from all the points to the line is as small as possible . The neural network has picked its parameters to make the distance between its simulated answers and the real therapists 's answers , and by doing this was able to simulate a therapist with 100 million parameters .

I recently took heed to them after my fiancé put an article in front of me and pointed out that my favourite drink might have actually been the cause of my struggles for years . I gave the drink up . This is my story:- As someone who had drank Diet Coke for nearly every single drink ( apart from the occasional cup of tea ) for the past 14 years it was very much part of my life . I have over the years had a great deal of issue with my weight . I always thought I was fat when I was younger ( I was pretty normal ) and so by the age of twenty I had developed an eating disorder . I would restrict my eating , dieting regularly , and drinking Diet Coke to keep me full . At first I would eat very nutritionally balanced meals , with a small deficit in calorie intake , of Vegetables , small pieces of protein and some unrefined carbs , but even when full I still wanted more and my weight loss was n't enough . What was a mild diet converted into an eating disorder which soon developed into full on bulimia which very quickly spiralled into cycles of over eating and craving food from morning to night . I was obsessed with food . I drank litres of Diet Coke to fill me and ensure my calorie count was low . I would drink it at breakfast , lunch and dinner ; if I was out on a night out , at yoga class or at the cinema , in fact I would drink it whenever possible . I did n't see this as a problem but more a taste option . As people around me would drink coffee and drinks higher in caffeine or calories I thought that my penchant for DCoke was pretty ok . I 've never been a water fan and it helped me to get my liquids down , I felt comfortable with how low calorie it was , so that was good by me . My weight however and cravings for food escalated disproportionately to the amount I ate or sometimes did n't eat . To lose any weight I 'd have to barely eat at all restricting calories down to a minimum . When I allowed myself to eat however I was a literal bottomless pit . I blamed this on having restricted my diet for so long and that my metabolism must have slowed down so much that it craved food all the time . The Speed of weight gain increased when I started eating normally once more . I entered a happy and successful relationship and began to eat regular meals which were balanced . I gained weight consistently and quickly , but I put it down to the damamge to my metabolism and it adjusting to the new intake . This is a reasonable thing to assume . I believe that it is partly true , but My appetite when full was insatiable and I could eat 4 - 5 large bowls of pasta at one sitting . This was an appetite I 'd never had beforez I Ate til I felt sick and craving high sugar and high fat food . My weight went up and up until I had gained 3 stone and my doctor told me I was in the overweight category . At this point I was still drinking Diet Coke at every moment possible . This brings me to 2 months ago when I gave up Diet Coke and it is one of the hardest things I 've ever done . I read an article shown to me by my partner and decided to prove him wrong in his blaming of Diet Coke for my appetitite problems and weight gain . I did n't want to give up Diet Coke for good . I love it . Still do . It was hell at first . I still ca n't see a can of it without getting cravings and it makes me shake and edgy to see it . The first week of giving up Diet Coke I lost half a stone without even noticing . My stomach was no longer bloated and I was no longer as gassy . My appetite has disappeared . I 've now on the way to my normal BMI , losing weight every day , and I no longer crave sugary foods . I feel full without over eating and leave food on the plate . I have lost over a stone without any effort at all . Previously it was a struggle to not want more and more food straight after eating . Now I am struggling to eat a full plate . I can see now that Diet Coke has played a massive part in my struggles with my weight for years because of the food cravings it caused and I honestly blame it for my bulimia .

When you combine a bunch of pigment , it forms a mixture of colors which can look brown or gray when over - mixed . This is also the reason why printed images look different than their digital counterparts : print works by adding different amounts of cyan , magenta , yellow , and black pigment . Screens work by adding / subtracting red , green , blue , and white lights .","Light can come in any wavelength . There 's nothing special about red , green , or blue in nature , what makes them special is that those are the three wavelengths of light that the human eye is sensitive to . Our eyes can detect red , green , or blue . Any other wavelength that 's visible to our eyes , but not at one of those wavelengths , is detected as some combination of those . So the wavelength halfway between red and green is seen by our eyes as yellow . But ... and this is the important part , if you combine a pure - red light and a pure - green light , to our eyes they look the same . They 're * not * actually the same - to some animal that could detect more colors it 'd be a crude approximation , but to the human eye it 's indistinguishable . So to reproduce any color the human eye can see with light , you only need red , green , and blue light . Pigments and materials work differently . When an object appears red , that means that the object is absorbing green and blue light , and the red light is bouncing off of it . So when you mix pigments , you get a new pigment that absorbs different colors , and reflects others more or less . Generally the more you mix , the more gets absorbed .","Because when you mix up light you mix up different wavelength . You only add more wavelength .

You add absorption / reflection properties of material , meaning that you usually remove more and more wavelength . For example , you project red , green and blue colour on the wall . You end up with pretty much all visible light wavelength so you see white . But a red pigment is a material that adsorb most light except red one .

I was told it takes some months before it really works , how come medicine does nt just work straight away ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["No offense , but your doctors there to field such questions . Your health matters , ask every question you can ask your doctor ! It takes time to build up body levels of the active ingredients in your drugs .","Azathioprine ( AZA ) works by interfering with DNA synthesis . Basically the molecule kind of looks like a DNA base , so your cells try to use it to construct DNA . When they do this AZA gets stuck in the cellular machinery and the whole process comes to a halt . AZA does this to your white blood cells and prevents them from dividing , reducing their number and thus their ability to cause autoimmune damage . So , why does this take so much time before you see the effect ? All of the white blood cells in your body come from stem cells , and the process of development from stem cell to fully functional white blood cell ( called hematopoesis ) takes some time . AZA prevents these cells replication , but does not do much to prevent their maturation . Because of this , once you start taking AZA creates a \" wave \" of reduced white blood cells that you do n't see until all of the cells that had already divided finish maturing . Imagine if everyone in the world stopped getting pregnant today . You would probably still see babies being born tomorrow , and the next day , and the day after that . In fact , you would not notice any change in the birth rate until 9 months from now , when all of the babies who had already been conceived were born . AZA is kinda doing the same thing to your immune system .","There are a bunch of reasons . One , drugs have a half life , that is that after so many hours , only half the drug is in your system ( it wears off ) . They also have a certain therapeutic range , that is too much and it makes your sick , not enough it does n't do anything . So a drug might need 5 - 10 mg in your system at all times to always work . If the half life is 12 hours then they can prescribe 5mg / twice per day . However with this it does n't really start working until the second dose , because you take your first pill and get 5 mg in your system and it drops below the therapeutic range instantly and does n't \" work \" for the next 12 hours , by which time you have 2.5 mg in your system . Take the next dose and you get 7.5 mg in your system and it starts working , but after a few hours it 's back below 5 mg . In the long run a 5mg / day dose will keep you in the 5 - 10 mg range , but it takes a while to build up to that . And during that time it 's either not working , or working for only a few hours between doses . Sometimes doctors will tell you to take a double dose on the first day to overcome this . It 's especially important with drugs that have very long half lives and a narrow therapeutic range , they have to subscribe tiny doses for the long run and it may not be enough on the first week . Second , many drugs do start working instantly , but the way they work means it greatly delays the response . Antibiotics frequently work by killing bacteria when they split ( during budding or something like that ) . The thing is if you take it , it might have enough in your system , but the bacteria might only split every 12 hours , so those first 6 - 12 hours , most of the bacteria are actually alive and healthy , it 's not until they attempt to grow that they get killed . And with that , you 're feeling sick , not because of the bacteria , but because of your bodies immune response to them and maybe the damage they did to you . Killing bacteria actually releases them into your blood which can make the immune response stronger . It 's not until the bacteria are gone that your body dials back it 's response , and even then you have damage that needs to heal , so things may still be sore even after it 's all clear . And to combine these points , many drugs act on your body slowly , so as to not shock or stress you . You might take a drug to suppress your immune system , but it actually suppresses it maybe 1 % from where it was yesterday , and maybe it ca n't do more because it acts on something that only allows that much change .

{"question":"What is consignment and how does it work ? If you have the time , please include a simple example in your answer . Thanks . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Consignment just means lending somebody else your property so that they can sell it for you . Let 's say you own a bookstore , and there 's a new author who wants people to buy his book . If you wanted , you could buy 500 copies of his book ( in this example , he has already published his book and has 500 copies lying around his house ) . He sells you 500 copies , you paid him money , and he goes along his merry way . That 's pretty risky for you though . Now for you to make a profit , you have to sell all those books , and for more than you paid for them . If nobody wants to buy the book , you just lost a lot of money and all you have are a bunch of worthless books . So instead of doing all that , you tell the author that you 'll sell his books on consignment . He gives you the books to put in your shop , and you do n't pay him any money up front . Every time somebody buys a copy , you keep some of the money and the author gets some of the money . If the book turns out to be terrible and nobody buys it , then the author can take the unsold copies back if he wants . So consignment is n't too different from normal sales , but the consignee ( the bookstore ) does n't have to take on any risk .","Consignment is a method of selling goods such as in a shop without the owner of the shop taking ownership of the goods . For example a normal shop might purchase goods from a supplier and then hold them in a shop until they are sold , owning the goods in the meantime . With consignment the shop owner only agrees to try to sell the goods from the supplier but the supplier retains ownership , agreeing to pay the shop owner a percentage of the sale of the goods when they occur .","You give stuff to a store or person to sell for you .

{"question":"The concept of ' plausible deniability ' ? Hi , I do n't understand plausible deniability ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Plausible deniability is basically the idea that an organization needs to do bad things in such a way as to make sure that leadership can credibly claim not to have been involved . So , imagine you have a company that has fallen on hard times . They need some new invention in order to revitalize the business . Some executive vice president realizes that a competitor has just such an invention , and realizes that they can steal it and get it to market before the competitor . But , if they do that , not only could the people involved go to jail , but the company itself could get sued . So , the VP goes to the CEO and asks if they should do \" anything it takes \" to save the company . The CEO says , \" of course , \" and does n't ask any more questions . The VP does n't tell the CEO anything else about the plan and steals the invention . Now , the CEO has \" plausible deniability \" with regard to the theft . If someone finds out that the invention was stolen and asks the CEO about it , the CEO can say honestly that they had no idea that the invention even existed , and never heard anything about a plan to steal it .","Plausible deniability is essentially a mechanism for senior , important members of an organisation to officially \" Not Know \" about the illegal or improper actions of their subordinates . It 's particularly common in large , hierarchical organisations where instructions are passed down the chain of command , and involve a lot of people . The ones at the ' bottom ' actually doing the dirty work have no direct proof that the orders came from the very top . One example might be in politics , where a candidate organises for slanderous accusations to be made against their opponent . If caught out , the candidate can claim it was a lowly staffer doing it on their own initiative . Often , the loyal staffer will willingly take the blame on their own shoulders to protect the candidate , and be rewarded in some way at a later date . Another example is organised crime . The Mafia is deliberately set up so that the lowly associates and wannabes ( who are most likely to get caught ) have contact and receive orders from their immediate superiors , and not from the bosses . This means that they have no direct information to implicate the senior members of the crime family even if they wanted to .","All of the answers are correct ; however , it is not strictly a business concept . There are everyday situations where people use plausible deniability . Here are two examples : 1 ) A guy wants to sleep with a girl . Instead of asking her outright , he asks if she wants to \" hang at my place \" or \" come up for a drink . \" If she says \" no \" , he can then plausibly deny that he was proposing sex . \" I just asked if you wanted a drink , nothing more . \" 2 ) Someone gets pulled over for speeding . Rather than outright bribing the cop to let him off , he says \" maybe we can take care of this right now . \" If the cop is crooked , he 'll take the bribe . If the cop is honest , the guy can plausibly deny that he was offering a bride because he did n't actually say so .

{"question":"How do air conditioners produce cold air ? I sound dumb when I ask this , but how do they produce cold air ? I understand how they produce heat as that seems fairly obvious , but I 'm clueless on them producing cold air . Thanks ! Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["The fluid used in an AC unit turns into a liquid when under high pressure and back into a gas when under low pressure . the exchange from liquid to gas absorbs energy ( think you need to heat water to get it to boil ) and transforming from a gas to a liquid releases energy ( think freezing water into ice , you 're removing heat from the water by placing it in a cold area that absorbs the heat ) . So an AC unit has an evaporator coil inside the ductwork in your home . this is a low pressure area where the fluid is able to turn from liquid to gas . It pulls the heat out of the air in your ducts to get energy to transform from liquid to gas . This cools the air in the ducts , which gets pushed to the rooms in your house . The gas then travels to a compressor which puts the gas under a high pressure which will cause it to transform back into a liquid . This releases the heat to the surrounding air . This is done outside so the heat is just dumped into the surrounding air . The big boxy units on the outside of the home do this . The liquid then goes back into the evaporator coil where it evaporates again , pulling heat out of the air inside , etc . The same thing is done in window units as well .. So an AC unit does n't make cold air , it just moves the heat from inside to outside . Your refrigerator works in the same way as well . There are also heat pumps , which are AC units running backwards , moving heat from outside to the inside of your home to heat it on cold days .","They do it by letting liquid evaporate . Liquid needs a lot of warmth to evaporate . The cold gas runs through a set of what 's basically radiators along wich a fan blows the air that has to be cooled .

It 's meant to help the instrument project its sound . The integral symbol comes from the [ long S ] ( URL_1 ) which is similar to the letter f , but unrelated . The s here stands for \" sum \" , since the integral is a form of summation .","The \" f \" hole is n't a cultural artifact . It 's an amplifier . The sound we hear is air that is compressed . A vibrating violin string compresses the air around it in a pattern our ears interpret as a musical tone . But that string , by itself , does n't vibrate a LOT of air . It 's pretty skinny . And it does n't give much ENERGY to the air it compresses , either . So the sound wo n't travel far . If you bowed a violin string alone ( or plucked a bare guitar string ) , nobody in a packed theater would hear your performance . Add a wooden board just behind the string , however , and it will also vibrate with the sound . Depending on how big the board is , it will push more air harder , making a louder sound that carries farther . Make that wooden board an open box , and now there 's a lot more volume of air that gets pushed . The sound is even easier to hear . A rectangular box is n't great , though . Some tones will sound fine , but higher and lower ones will be too thin or quiet . That 's because the box is a simple shape that resonates ( vibrates along with ) a narrow band of frequencies . Give that box a more complex shape , so bits of it can resonate with the high notes as well as the low notes , and you 've got a pretty good instrument . Centuries of trial and error led to the violin shape we all recognize as being fantastic for this . ( And they found that different woods resonate better , different densities , different internal structures , etc . ) Why an open box , though ? Why not cover it up , and have even MORE resonance and amplification ? Like shouting \" echo ! \" in a tunnel . The problem is , the air INSIDE the box has to get out , to send the sound to the listener . Differently - shaped holes are better or worse at doing the job . If the hole is too big , you might as well get rid of the top of the box entirely . If it is too small , you 're muffling your sound . If you start with a simple circular hole , like a guitar , that 's not bad . But over the centuries people figured out that you can get an even better result if you close up the center of the circle . If you just cut out the perimeter of the circle , you preserve more of the echo energy , and still get that air pumping out to the audience . If you split the circle into two \" C \" shapes , you can put one on either side of the strings , so the input is n't interfering with the output . Remember how we reshaped the box to resonate better with different tones ? How about we fiddle ( ha ) with that C. Instead of a constant curve , let 's have part be tight and part be long , to maximize the wavelengths we can project . And that 's how you get an \" f \" curve .

{"question":"Cosmic microwave background The whole wikipedia page flew over my head . Help . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Let 's first understand something about light . It can be understood as a series of alternating dips and peaks in electromagnetic energy ... called a wave . Since light moves forward all the time , we can ask how many dips and peaks does it make when in travels a given distance . The distance betweeen two dips ( or two peaks ) is called the \" Wavelength \" of light . Rays of light are defined by \" wavelengths\" ... and light of different wavelengths together makes up the spectrum . The region on the spectrum that represents 400 - 600 nanometres wave - lengths is called visible light , because our eyes can see these wavelengths . As the wavelengths grow shorter , you get UV , X - Rays and Gamma rays . As the wavelengths get longer , you get infra - red , radio and microwaves . Microwaves are about 10 - 40 cm in wavelength . Imagine a rubber sheet on which you make a lot of lines with a Sharpie until the whole rubber sheet is covered with lines . Now you take that rubber sheet and stretch it a lot . You see that your original lines also stretch , such that they are much longer than they were before . And of course , because the sheet has stretched , they are no longer as dense as before ... but they are still there all over the sheet . Remember this picture . When the universe was really really small and chock full of energy , light came into existence that had very very small wavelengths , like gamma rays and X - rays . But you know what happened next , the universe expanded hugely and the tiny wavelengths of this ancient light got stretched such that now they are in the size range of wavelengths we call microwaves . Just like the lines on your rubber sheet stretched when you stretched the rubber sheet . And because they were present BEFORE the universe expanded to its current state , they exist everywhere in the universe , but of course , they are not as dense now . They are rather weak , but they are there . The upshot of this is that when we actually try to send signals using light ( like radio and so on ) , on the receiver antenna side you always pick up some of these ancient cosmic microwaves in our radio equipment .... it 's like an even background noise of microwaves that exists no matter where you are in the cosmos . Hence termed , the cosmic microwave background . It was discovered to exist first , then explained using theory , confirmed , and then by calculating backwards from how much the wavelengths have actually stretched we ended up calculating how old the Universe must be !","1 ) When matter have energy it have a temperature . The more energy , the higher the temperature . But matter will slowly lose that energy through radiation ( photon ) . But the specific wavelength of that radiation will depend on the temperature . The higher the temperature , the smaller the wavelength . 2 ) When you heat up a solid , it become a liquid . Heat it up more it become a gas . Heat it up even more and it become a plasma . What happen is that atoms ca n't keep their electron anymore and we call them Ions . A plasma of ions is really good at capturing photon , so it 's always opaque , but a gas of atoms ( in the case of the early universe , mostly hydrogen ) can let light pass through it . 3 ) When we talk about the big bang we talk about a very high temperature and dense early universe . As it expand it cool down . We know at which temperature hydrogen and helium go from a gas to a plasma . So we know that at one point in the pass the universe was mostly plasma . At that moment it was at a specific temperature and it emitted a specific wavelength of radiation . That radiation ( photon ) was absorbed by the surrounding plasma so photon emitted during that period never went very far . But we also know that later in the universe , it was cold enough for atoms to form , become a gas and letting photon pass . So at some point in the past , the universe suddenly become transparent and the photon that were emitted during that time are the thermal radiation with a specific wavelength link to the temperature of the universe at that moment . 4 ) That radiation is the oldest we can see and it 's the Cosmic microwave background radiation . It was n't emitted at microwave , it was a smaller wavelength when it was emitted , but it travelled so much time that it lost a lot of it 's energy , increase it 's wavelength over time . 13 billions years ish later , it lost so much energy that it 's a microwave that we can detect and analyse .","In the beginning , everything was really close together , and thus really , really hot . We 're talking temperatures that make the core of the sun seem like absolute zero in comparison . Hot things glow . At the beginning of time , everything went from being really small to not as small , and then kept getting bigger . This is what we call the big bang , though a better term would be \" the everywhere stretch \" . Space got bigger , and matter expanded to fill it . As it expanded , it cooled , and at a certain point , it reached a temperature and density that allowed it to be transparent . All the thermal radiation from before that point was suddenly released and allowed to travel essentially freely . At this point in time the entire universe glowed orange . All of it . Anywhere you looked in any direction would be orange . As space continued to expand , matter cooled , and the light it released stretched out as well , the wavelength getting longer and longer , until eventually what was once orange light is now microwaves . Now , any direction you look is the color of microwaves , unless something is in the way ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure!

Sure , squares are made of four 90 ° right angles , and cutting a square diagonally gives you two triangles and splits two of those angles in half . That 's true enough . /u / anonymoushero1 's formula for the number of degrees for a polygon is also good , but I do n't feel like it gets to * why * . Fair warning , I 'm going to be a bit long - winded to dismiss potential objections and paint a picture . I 'm also going to say \" line \" a lot , where I really mean \" line segment \" , just for ease of reading . As an aside before I really get into that , the * units * we 're dealing with are n't really important , as the others have suggested . You can measure an angle in degrees , or in radians ( which you 'll probably learn about soon , if you have n't already ) . There are a few more units that see some use , or you could invent your own . URL_0 The more interesting part , I think , is what we 're measuring . * Why * do polygons have that much rotation in their angles ? Why do we start at triangles ? Why is the formula ( sides - 2)*180 ? Starting at triangles is probably the easiest one to answer . If you have a single side , a single line , with no other context around it , there 's no reason to even talk about rotations . Rotated relative to * what * , exactly ? If you insist that the line is on a grid , perhaps , you 're implying angles formed with the lines that define the grid , but in a pure blank space , there 's nowhere to measure an angle from . It 's a nonsensical idea . But if you have a second line , you can rotate them as much as you like . For ease of contemplation , it helps to keep our measurements to 0 ° -360 ° by adding or subtracting full rotations until we end up in that range ( so that a 540 ° turn becomes only 180 ° , for example ) , but again , as much rotation as you want . However , you ca n't make a closed shape out of two lines . Maybe the closest thing would be a pair of lines with a shared vertex overlapping at a 0 ° angle , or with one of them rotated around to make a straight 180 ° angle . Alright , time for the fun part . Now , imagine a straight angle , and add a third line connecting the outer ends of the rays . At either end , we 've got two 0 ° angles , and in the middle , we 've got the 180 ° straight angle . This is n't * technically * a triangle right now , because there 's no interior area . From a bird 's eye view , it just looks like a single line , and we only know it has three vertices because we said so . But it 's sort of an extreme , squashed version of a triangle . If you were to take the middle of that straight angle and tug it upwards just a tiny bit ( our lines are stretchy and do n't bend ) , all of a sudden it * is * a triangle , and it should be easy to see why it has 180 ° of rotation in it : we narrowed the middle straight angle a bit , say to 170 ° , but all of that rotation got transferred and split between the two zero angles , which are now 5 ° each . There 's a key detail I glossed over there . Until you put that vertex in the middle and tug , there 's no angle worth measuring . It 's just a boring , 1D line , and it 's not \" worth \" any rotation . Otherwise , you could take an equilateral triangle and say that it 's got three extra vertices , one in the middle of each side , and now the whole thing does n't contain 180 ° , but 180 ° +(180 ° +180 ° +180 ° )=720 ° . That 's silly . When we 're talking about polygons , we consider straight angles to just be lines with no vertex in the middle . That said ... what about squares , or anything bigger ? What if you do take that triangle , and add a vertex in one side , and tug ? That extra vertex definitely makes it a quadrilateral . And if you only tug a little bit , that angle is going to be close to , but just a little bit less than 180 ° ... and just like with the triangle , that \" little bit \" shows up split into the two angles at either end of our new side . * * Every time you add a vertex and tug , and thus turn a single straight side into two sides , you add 180 ° to the shape . * *"],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure!

More religion means more children . Less access to health care means more children . Earlier age of marriage means more children .

Also , minorities and immigrants from less developed countries tend to * want * larger families because of their culture . These groups also tend to be poor . ----- * * EDUCATION : Less education = more children * * Poor people tend to be less educated - they perform poorly in school , are more likely to be expelled or drop out , and struggle to afford higher education . There are many theories about why education relates to family size : 1 ) Women with less education are less likely to be able to support themselves independently . Because they rely upon a husband , they tend to think of their contributions to family as more important to contributing to economy . Ergo , more children . 2 ) Women with more education will have a career , not just a job . They prefer to work rather than parent , and will focus on vocational success . Children and families make financial success more difficult . By focusing on a career , the woman neglects settling down to have children until later in her life . 3 ) People who are more educated tend to have better impulse control . They are more likely to plan out when they want to have a family based upon their finances . They are less likely to have unprotected sex , or to use drugs and substances that might result in accidental pregnancies ( hooking up while drunk , for instance ) . They are also more aware of the various birth - control options available and will seek them out . 4 ) Poorly educated people might not know about all the contraception options that exist , how to use them properly , or where they might obtain birth - control pills or spermicides etc . Most individuals learn about contraception in school - so where do drop outs learn about it ? They might not have access to Google ... * * RELIGIOSITY : More religion means larger families * * Poor individuals are more likely to be religious that wealthy individuals . Also , less educated individuals are more likely to be dogmatically religious that people with a 4 - year degree . This can have several outcomes : 1 ) Contraceptives are purposefully ignored . Catholics , for instance , view the use of birth control or condoms as a sin . Many denominations view abortions or \" the morning after pill \" as murder . 2 ) Some religious denominations actively encourage women to be caring mothers with lots of children . You see this more with fringe groups , like the ( small ) snake - handling group within Pentecostalism or the ( small ) polygamist group within Mormonism . 3 ) Religion encourages an early age of marriage . The younger a woman is when married , the more children she will have over her lifetime . Also , married couples are more likely to have unprotected sex than couples that are cohabiting or having pre - marital sex . * * INCOME : Less money means more children * * This is pretty obvious when you think about it . Contraception costs money . Condoms , birth control , spermicide , morning - after pill , and abortions are all expensive - particularly if you add up the cost - per - month and look at years at a time . Most birth - control pills require prescriptions , which means doctor visits , which are super expensive if you do n't have insurance . Even though condoms can be bought for a dollar a piece , that 's expensive if you are living on welfare ( and I do n't think food - stamps cover contraception ) . ~~Hysterectomies~~ Tubal ligation and vasectomies are also a rather common contraceptive used by middle and upper class individuals . Usually after they have had a child or two and think their family is big enough - so no surprise children later in life . Also , people with more money tend to thing in economic terms . Children are expensive , and people with money budget for this ; they will wait to have children until they can afford them , and will prefer small families because it is easier to pay for karate for 2 boys than for 5 . This thought process is n't seen in poor families . * * RACE : Minorities and Immigrants are over - represented among the poor . Immigrants from developing countries are more likely to * want * larger families . * * Developing countries do n't have large families * only * because of lack of birth control , they have large families because it is * culturally acceptable and preferable * to have large families . If you take a couple from Sub - Saharan Africa , teach them all about condoms and birth control , and put them in America and give them access to contraception they are still more likely to have a large family because * they will want to have many children * . Culturally speaking , more children means the parents are better people . This idea carries over into the children of immigrants , as well as the grandchildren . The family size declines with each generation , and by the 4th generation the birth rate looks more like the rates of the host culture . ----- EDIT 1 : Clarity and phrasing . EDIT 2 : Removing implied causality statements .","My observation as a doctor in a low socioeconomic area is that sometimes women with poor education and little career prospects do n't have any other goals in life other than being a mother .","My input as a middle european : Point one , as mentioned : Age of \" more educated parents \" When you study until your mid twenties , find a job and start a career , it is not uncommon to have your first child after your 30th birthday . Since you know the cost of education , and you want to provide your children a good education , you will most likely limit yourself to a max of 2 children . ( Little example , if both husband and wife have a university degree they will in all likelyhood have a family net income of 4000 - 5000€/month . Cost for rent , two cars , additional private insurances and so on will amount to about 2000 - 2500 € monthly and if you have a credit running you have about 1500 € left for \" living \" . Now if you want yoour child to study there will be monthly monetary need per child of about 1000€. One is ok , two is feasible , 3 will definitely strain your budget in a very inconvenient way . So an educated family of 2 will , by the age of 35 , have produced 2 offspring . Now if you take the stereotypical \" Hartz4 family \" in germany : Both paternts are unemployed , each of them receiving 700 € per month from the state , their accomodation is paid by the state , in many cases the first child comes at age of 16 for the woman . They have never worked , their basic needs are met by the state and as long as she continues to pop out children every 2 - 3 years the state wo n't bother her about a job . As soon as the oldest children reach the age of 15 they start to repeat the cycle since they have never seen their parents work , they \" know \" that the state will take care of them , and as long as they continue that way they wo n't have a problem . So by the time that the arents are 35 they will most likely have 3 - 5 children plus 2 - 4 grandchildren . Or as another user posted : Idiocracy . I once saw a documentation about a german city of 500.000 inhabitants where nearly 50 % of al inhabitants either were retired or unemployed ( children below 15 excluded ) ....

This can make it more difficult for them to prevent unintended pregnancies.\\n\\nBeliefs and values: Some people who have less education may hold different beliefs and values about family size and parenting than people who have more education.

In some cases, having a larger family may be seen as a way to provide additional income or support for the household.\\n\\nLimited access to healthcare: People who have less education may also have less access to healthcare services, including family planning services.

{"question":"Why cooked food can stay under a heat lamp for hours and be ok , while if it 's in a hot car for 2 hours it will go bad . Is n't it the same type of heat ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["The idea around food holding temperatures is to control the growth of bacteria , most of which breed and multiply best between 40 degrees F and 135 degrees F. This range of temperatures is referred to as the \" Danger Zone \" . Basically bacteria is ALWAYS present on your food , and always multiplying , so keeping cooked food hot is about slowing down the growth of bacteria . Your body can handle some bacteria without you getting sick , but once that bacteria has grown at an exponential rate , doubling itself every sixty seconds for several hours , there are too many for your body to fight , and you get sick . Keeping hot food hot helps SLOW the growth of bacteria , but not stop it . The USDA mandates that prepared food , once heated to proper temperature , may be held hot ( above 135 F ) for four hours before it must be discarded - it is no longer considered safe . With that in mind , I 've seen two methods of temperature holding in the food service industry - heat lamps and steam tables . Heat lamps are typically in the service window - where the waiter gets your food from the kitchen to give to you . When you and your family place your order , some items take longer than others to make , so your nephew 's chicken nuggets will come out much quicker than your filet mingon . We do n't want Jimmy 's nuggets to get cold while your filet is cooking , so we put it under the heat lamp to keep it toasty until your whole family 's order is ready . The heat lamp does tend to dry out food and make it look gross so a good restaurant will have a 15 minute limit on how long that food can stay in the window , well below the USDA guideline of how long prepared food can be kept hot . Where things can get dangerous is with steam tables . Steam tables are basically tubs of heated water with your stainless steel pan of food sitting on top of it . Hotels use them , casinos , etc . The steam table IS meant to keep hot food hot for a period of up to four hours . USDA requires that we check the temperature of this food every hour , to make sure it has n't dropped into the Danger Zone ( below 135 F ) , and to discard it if it does . And once again , to chuck the whole batch after four hours has passed , since that bacteria has had too long to grow on your food and will most likely make you ill . If you really want to scare yourself , look up \" Clostridium perfringens \" AKA the cafeteria germ , which grows best at steam - table temperatures and causes epidemics in old folk 's homes . So here is the answer to your question : The USDA does n't care what you do with your own food in in your car since you 're not selling or serving it to anyone else . But if you hypothetically were going to sell that food , and you needed to comply with serve - safe industry standards , you would need to make sure your car was at least 135 F , check the temp of the food every hour , and discard it after four hours . Oh , and , since your leftovers most likely fell to a dangerous temperature while it was on your table in the restaurant , you would have to reheat it to 165 F again before transferring it to your hot car . Ha ! Obviously nobody can do that . Your food might be fine . There is simply a high likelihood that your car is operating as a giant human - body temperature ( 96 F ) organism to breed an ungodly amount of Clostridium perfringens all over your burrito before you go ahead and eat it .

Nationalism has done well over the past few centuries because it can beat up the other -isms . Let 's consider Europe in the 1700s . There are countries , but few people feel strongly about what country they 're from . Outside Paris , only a minority of French people know French , speaking all kinds of other Romance languages like Breton , Provencal , and Occitan . The Italian peninsula is a bunch of rival city - states and regions , and Germany is a loose association of little kingdoms and principalities .

Even when the \" United States \" threw off British rule , they preferred to remain thirteen distinct states with limited central power . Then , at the end of the 1700s , the French Revolution happened . Ordinary people overthrew their monarch and declared a single French state where all citizens had rights , power was centralized in Paris , and everything was standardized . The monarchs of Europe , fearing for their own heads if this trend continued , declared war . So this shaky new republic drafted huge armies , organized them by merit instead of wealth and nobility , thrashed the invaders , then expanded .

By the time Napoleon became emperor , it was pretty obvious that a single nation working as a whole was far more powerful than any number of smaller regions . It took the rest of Europe about twenty years of combined effort to finally contain France . This lesson would be repeated in reverse when the German states under Bismarck unified in war against France in 1870 - 71 , and won . Their new nation formed the greatest military and industrial power on the continent . To a lesser extent , the Italian states also gained greater influence and power by unifying into one nation . In the United States , the Civil War likewise showed the power of strong central authority over anything looser or more regional .

This is how many modern software applications — especially web browsers — keep users up to date with the latest hotfixes / patches .","Think of it like this .. You are a mechanic named mister exe and you 're working under a car . You have a multi - tool ( like a swiss army knife or a leatherman ) in your hand and a tray with all your other tools on the floor beside your car . For some reason , you call the tray your dll tray . You can do a bit of the job with the multi - tool , but every so often ( or possibly very often ) , you need a tool from your dll tray . You ca n't see the tray , but you know where the it is , so it 's easy for you to find the right tool by feel , use it and put it back when you are done . That 's basically how a program works . The main exe has a few tools built in that are a small part of the programs functionality , but most of the functionality is off to one side in various dlls where the main exe can grab them if it needs to and put them back when it 's done . Hotfixes are fixes that change the dll on the fly without touching the main exe . Going back to the mechanic analogy , imagine one of the tools in your dll tray is a particularly useful screwdriver . You use it all the time but it is a lot of effort cause it 's a manual screwdriver . You 've ordered a new battery powered one and it 's supposed to be arriving today , but you have n't got time to wait for the courier . You go to work with the old screwdriver in the tray . Lucky for you , you 've got a trusted apprentice named boy windows . Every so often you ask boy windows if the new screwdriver has arrived . On the fourth time you ask , boy windows says , \" yes , it 's at the front counter . \" You then say to boy windows , \" Ok windows , I wo n't use a tool from the dll tray for 5 minutes , please take the tray , swap the old screwdriver for the new one and put the treaty back EXACTLY where it is now . Boy windows does this and without you even stopping working on the car , your tools have been upgraded . This is basically how a hotfix works . Most of the time windows stops any program from touching an applications dll files while the application is running ( even the application itself is prevented from touching it 's own dlls ) . But if a background process has finished downloading a new version of one of your dlls from the internet , the main program can ask windows to swap the dll on the fly , during which process the main program ca n't use the dll . Once it 's all swapped over , windows puts the new version exactly where the old one was and the main program can start using the new version as if nothing had changed . So perhaps the particular dll contains all the functions in the game that generate opponents for you to fight . Swapping out the dll like this means that suddenly your game might have a new opponent you 've never seen before because this new opponent is in the new dll . Hope this helps explain it .","They plan ahead that some stuff is definitely going to change a lot and that every time the game runs it should go \" hey , every time this runs check this website to see how much damage a punch should do \" and some games are server based to begin with and on those they can change all sorts of things without you having to change the client because the client is n't even doing very much ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Hot fixes in video games work by allowing developers to make small changes or fixes to a game without the need to release a full update.

The primary immune response is a bit shit and does n't get rid of the pathogen quickly enough however as a result of the primary immune response memory cells are produced . These memory cells can divide rapidly when the pathogen is encountered again resulting in a much stronger secondary immune response that can actually deal with the pathogen . So the vaccine causes the production of memory cells and you 're covered as long as you have the memory cells . The cells can reduce in number over time which is why sometimes you need booster jabs but as long as you have memory cells for that pathogen you are immune ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Vaccines work by teaching your body how to defend itself against a particular disease.

Some vaccines provide immunity that lasts for many years, while others may need to be given more frequently to maintain immunity.\\n\\nRabies is a viral disease that can be fatal if it is not treated promptly. The rabies vaccine works by introducing a small amount of a killed or weakened form of the rabies virus into your body. Your body's immune system recognizes the virus as foreign and produces antibodies to fight it off. These antibodies remain in your body and provide protection against the disease.\\n\\nThe rabies vaccine is usually given as a series of shots over a period of several weeks. After you have received all of the necessary shots, your body should be able to produce enough antibodies to protect you against the disease for a long time.

Since uninstalling programs is a relatively uncommon thing , there 's very little reason to put extra work into making it so you can safely remove multiple programs .","When windows installs or uninstalls a program , it does several things , the first and most obvious is the installation of files , such as the .exe file that serves as the launching point for many programs . the second is it edits the registry - an operating system level database that stores settings for things like user accounts , drivers , security functions , and the kernel , and that last one is the biggest reason why windows does n't want two programs being installed / uninstalled at the same time . The kernel is the lowest level of an operating system , it is the part that takes information from the physical aspects of a computer like the CPU , RAM , GPU , and Storage and communicates it to Applications . If the kernel develops a problem , you 're computer will have very serious problems . So if an application is editing the registry and something goes wrong or there is a malicious piece of code , your computer can crash , and if those changes saved , your computer wo n't boot again except into safe mode , at which point you need to start going through recovery procedures . However , if two applications are editing the registry at the same time , Windows does n't have a way of knowing which application made which edits . I saw you made a comment to another response in which you state that you normally just delete the folder and its contents , and that will free up the drive space . However when you do this the registry is not edited and the settings for the removed program are still there . On older systems especially , if the registry becomes to large it will slow down computer boot - up and may even prevent the computer from booting entirely . While the effects of an over - large registry are significantly reduced on operating systems like Windows XP , Vista , 7 , 8 and 10 , the fact is that if you have your computer for years your registry could eventually build to the point where it is a problem ."],"chatgpt_answers":["When you uninstall a program or app from the control panel, the process involves deleting files and making changes to various settings on your computer.

{"question":"Why does software have bugs ? I get that an OS like Windows has a lot of written code , but there are thousands of people working on it and I assume , that there are some basics that have been coded and reviewed several times . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Because humans are not perfect . A bug is a condition where the executiin of code results in an error . While there are many ways to test code , the more complex it gets , the harder it is to find and prevent possible problems .","Writing perfect code is a very hard thing to do . When complexity increases , so many things depend on each other and expect certain things that bugs are going to be there .","Let me give you a quick example : if ( someNumber < 10 ) foo ( ) ; if ( someNumber > 10 ) bar ( ) ; Spot the bug ? What do we do if someNumber * is * 10 ? We missed that case . Let 's fix it : if ( someNumber < = 10 ) foo ( ) ; if ( someNumber > 10 ) bar ( ) ; That was an easy one though . Let 's try something a bit harder . int x = 10 ; int y = 2.5 ; int z = x + y ; What 's the value of z ? You would think it 's 12.5 , right ? That 's wrong . It 's 12 . What 's the bug ? Well , here , we made an error in choosing our data types . An \" int \" is a primitive integer , which can * only * be whole numbers ( that is the definition of an integer , after all ) . What if we use more complicated data types , like a double or float , which * do * support fractional numbers . Let 's try that , then . int x = 10 ; double y = 2.5 ; int z = x + y ; Hang on , that still only makes z = 12 . y may be a double , but z is n't . Let 's fix it again . int x = 10 ; double y = 2.5 ; double z = x + y ; We fixed it , finally . Except , maybe we did n't . Some languages down - cast types during the arithmetic . Since we do x + y , the results may be turned into an int before being assigned to z , since x was the first parameter . So z may be 12 , or it may be 12.5 , depending on how the particular language handles the math . Granted , most languages will handle this the way you expect , and z will be 12.5 . Let 's get more difficult still : // buffer is where we are temporarily storing the keys that the user presses . This is called an \" array \" , and allows you to store multiple items in one spot . It works like this : if I store ' H ' ' E ' ' L ' ' L ' and ' O ' in buffer , buffer[0 ] is the location for ' H ' , buffer[1 ] is the location for ' E ' , etc . // charactersSoFar is the number of characters the user has entered so far . This is so we can find the right place in buffer to place the new character . // keypress is the key that the user just pressed . captureKeypress(char [ ] buffer , int charactersSoFar , char keypress ) { // If we have typed as many characters as the buffer can hold , we need to make the buffer bigger ( we double its size ) if ( buffer.size = = charactersSoFar ) buffer = char[buffer.size * 2 ] ; // If the keypress is a valid character , we add it to the end of the buffer , and increment the charactersSoFar counter if ( isValidCharacter(keypress ) ) { buffer[charactersSoFar ] = keypress charactersSoFar++ ; } // If the keypress is a backspace , decrement the charactersSoFar counter , and delete that keypress ( by overwriting it with the null - character \\0 ) if ( isBackspace(keypress ) ) { charactersSoFar-- ; buffer[charactersSoFar ] = ' \\0 ' ; } } What 's the bug here ? This one 's a little trickier . Much more subtle . In fact , it was so subtle , that a bug along these very lines was just patched in the Grub bootloader two years ago ( a popular tool for installing Linux / multiple operating systems ) , after years of being around . Look at what happens when we add characters to our buffer . If it gets too big , we make it bigger . If it starts off with space for 8 characters , and we type \" Password123 \" , as soon as we type ' 1 ' , it will become big enough for 16 characters , and we keep incrementing our \" charactersSoFar \" variable to keep track of how many characters are currently in our buffer . Look at what happens when we * delete * characters though . Let 's say you type \" Test \" . charactersSoFar will be 4 . Then we press backspace . Now our buffer has \" Tes \" and charactersSoFar will be 3 . What happens when you press backspace 10 more times ? Now your buffer has nothing in it , and charactersSoFar will be -7 . What will happen when you type again ? Before we get to that though , I need to explain how arrays work . buffer is an array , which is a fancy way for saying an indexed memory address . When you create an array , the computer gives you an address in memory ( let 's say , x100 ) . Then , when you put something in buffer[0 ] , it actually gets put into x100 , and when you put something into buffer[1 ] , it actually gets put into x101 . Back to our buffer when we press backspace too many times . What happens when you put something into buffer[-7 ] then ? Well , the same thing . It gets put into x093 , which is memory that something else in your program was probably using . Press backspace enough times , and you can delete everything in memory before where your buffer is stored . This vulnerability existed in Grub for a long time , and if you pressed backspace enough times , it would delete some things in memory that prevented access to someone 's computer , and would allow a malicious user to take control of your computer without your password . tl;dr Computer bugs can be very , very subtle , and the more people working on it means even more chances for miscommunication or misunderstanding . Think back to when your elementary school teacher told you to write instructions on \" how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich \" . It 's basically like that , but a lot harder ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Software can have bugs for a variety of reasons.

Think about blowing up a balloon , bike tire , or other inflatable object . It 's pretty easy to blow or pump air into at first because there 's very little air pressure inside .

As a result, the gasoline may not burn as well in a combustion engine, which can lead to reduced performance and efficiency. This process is often referred to as \"stale\" or \"old\" gasoline.\\n\\nTo understand this process in more detail, it's helpful to know that gasoline is made up of a mixture of hydrocarbons, which are molecules that contain hydrogen and carbon atoms. These hydrocarbons are responsible for the energy that is released when gasoline is burned in a combustion engine.

","human_answers":["First up , it 's not having an unusually hard time getting out of recession . These things take a lot of time to correct themselves . Nevertheless , Greece has some especially hard challenges , specifically Europe and Greece . First , Europe . The system should work like this : - when economic activity drops , a government automatically finds its tax base shrinking and its expenditures rising ( due to increased welfare , business assisstance etc . ) - this results in the government increasing its debt . ( Governments must always have debt to maintain liquidity in the credit market , but that 's another story ) - as economic activity drops and unemployment increases , so domestic production also drops . This causes imports to rise . - in turn this puts downward pressure on the value of the currency . Which acts to make imports more expensive . This is the start of the turnaround . - the lower exchange rate assists exporters to be more competitive with other countries . This means exports rise . - as exports rise domestic production goes up and unemployment goes down . - government expenditure drops and tax receipts go up . Also a decent amount of foreign ( high value ) money from exports finds its way to government . - this high value foreign money can be used to rapidly pay off government debt that was issued in the low value domestic money , and has dropped with the exchange rate . - as the debt is reduced , the exchange rate begins to rise and the economy starts to stabilise . However , in Europe the currency ( the Euro ) ca n't devalue unless the whole continent is in equally bad shape ( Which they are not ) . So the key event that triggers a recovery never occurs . As an alternative , Europe puts pressure on members who are in trouble to cut taxes and spending , in the hope that lower taxes increase the money supply , which is supposed to drive domestic demand and create recovery that way . But it often does n't work . That 's because a lot of spending in a downturn i d 's focused on keeping marginal players in the game earning money and paying tax . Cutting spending wipes these people out , reducing the tax base further and damaging the businesses they spend money at . This often means that the benefits of austerity are swallowed up I the extra damage it does . What would work is transferring money from parts of Europe that are doing well and spending it to support the marginal players in markets that are n't doing so well . This is largely how a country like the US stabilises state economies that ca n't trigger recovery by devaluing the currency . The second problem is Greece itself . As a former socialist state , the number of people avoiding tax but collecting welfare ( while working ) is very large , so whatever recovery might be possible , the culture of handouts and tax cheats makes it all that much harder","Lot 's of people without a job . The Unemployment rate in Greece is around 23.3 % and the between young adults ( 15 - 24 ) is over 59 % .

Here are a few common methods:\\n\\nPushing the dent out from the inside: If the dent is small and located in an area where it's possible to access the back side of the panel (like the hood or a door), a mechanic might try to push the dent out from the inside using a special tool called a dent puller. The mechanic will use the dent puller to apply pressure to the back side of the dent, slowly working it back into its original shape.\\n\\nFilling and sanding the dent: If the dent is too large or too deep to be repaired by pushing it out, the mechanic might try to fill it in using a special body filler. The filler is a thick, gooey substance that can be smoothed over the dent to fill in the damaged area. Once it's dry, the mechanic will sand the area down until it's smooth and even with the rest of the car.\\n\\nPainting the repaired area: After the dent has been repaired, the mechanic will need to paint the area to match the rest of the car. They will first apply a layer of primer, which helps the paint adhere to the surface. Then they will apply several layers of paint, using a special tool called a spray gun to apply it evenly. Finally, they will apply a layer of clear coat, which helps protect the paint and give it a glossy finish.\\n\\nI hope that helps!

The real difference is how the economics play out . Traditional lawsuits are usually driven by one individual ( or business ) who has a specific claim against another individual ( or business ) . But lawsuits ( lawyers ) cost money . In the usual case , the amount of an individual class member 's claim may be too low to justify paying a lawyer - like when a cellular carrier overcharges by a few cents per month , or when a company steals wages from its employees a few dollars at a time . By permitting people to sue as a class , the amount in controversy can be very high , and so the lawyers for the class are willing to work for free on behalf of all these similarly situated people in exchange for a ( sometimes very large , usually around 30 % ) piece of the overall recovery . The policy behind class actions is a good one : people and companies should not be able to get away with cheating or harming people \" just a little \" simply because they know the cost of a lawsuit would be prohibitive .

So if you put frozen food in a microwave that is the worst case scenario for it and it can boil part of the food while other parts still have not thawed .

Magnetic north is pointing in the direction of the magnetic field .

But , if the dose is too high , then the depressing effect occurs to a greater degree and in more areas of the brain , leading to overall depression of bodily function . Which brings me to nicotine - nicotine binds to receptors in the brain that usually bind acetylcholine ( which , in the peripheral nervous system is responsible mainly for the parasympatheric [ \" relaxing \" ] portion and muscle contraction - nicotine does n't act on the PNS or muscles though , [ otherwise it would kill you ] ( URL_0 ) . We know that nicotine causes certain neurons to release dopamine and activates the sympathetic nervous system [ \" stimulating \" ] , but it also appears to be that nicotine stimulates the release of endogenous opioids , which could be behind the relaxing effect .

","human_answers":["The ocean - atmosphere system is extremely complex and there are still many unknowns , so there is no particularly simple answer to this question . But as a generalisation , it would be more correct to say that winds drive oceanic currents than the other way around . Winds have a very important impact on ocean circulation and they are the cause of the large gyres that dominate most ocean basins . The other main driver of ocean circulation is the thermohaline circulation ( driven by density differences ) . The North Atlantic is a good example that illustrates both - the Gulf Stream is largely wind - driven , whereas the large - scale sinking of cold , saline waters around Iceland is thermohaline driven . Ocean circulation does have an impact on winds . The oceans are a significant mode of heat transport on the earth so without them , the winds would be stronger . The resulting changes in heat distribution can also affect wind patterns . But generally speaking , the large - scale patterns in the wind are not really caused by ocean circulation whereas ocean circulation most definitely is controlled to a large extent by wind . Of course , the ultimate driver of both is radiation from the sun .","Neither , both are driven primarily by the sun . The sun heats some water / air more than water / air elsewhere .

In 1969 a new organization called the Provisional IRA emerged , whose intention was to use acts of violence against the police and against civilians to encourage the British to withdraw from Northern Ireland , allowing Northern Ireland to unify with the Republic of Ireland , and making all of Ireland a united republic , free of British rule . They 've been on cease - fire since 1997 , they supported the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 , and they disarmed in 2005 .

Sinn Fein and the IRA have always been linked , although Sinn Fein denies any formal ties . Sinn Fein is the legitimate face of Irish Republicanism , the IRA was the militant face .","# HISTORY Hello my friend . The IRA is the Irish Republican Army and takes many forms throughout history . A quick view of the history . In 1171 the Pope made the King of England the Lord of Ireland ( ELI5 the leader of Ireland ) . With this the Kingdom of England took over Ireland . The Irish did n't like this and they rebelled . This got a lot worse when the religious divide came . After the Act of Union with Ireland 1800 the Irish were represented in Westminster . In 1885 the Home Rule Party was formed , they wanted a federal British Empire with an Imperial Parlaiment in Westminster and a Parliament in Dublin . This is similar to federal states like USA . The HRP was relplaced by other parties who became more pro inderpendance . In 1916 the Irish had there first rising in a long time and the Provisional Republic of Ireland stood a proud nation among the nations of the world for 3 days . # TYPES OF IRA In 1918 another rising came , this one was much more succesful . This was the first IRA , or the Old IRA . They were fighting for an independant Ireland . They made peace with the British and the Irish Free State was formed , this free state was owned by the British Crown . The treaty led to a split in the IRA and the anti treaty members remained IRA and the pro treaty members became the National Army of Ireland . The Irish and British put down the IRA . After the 1920s the action died down with moderate acts of terror both in the Irish Free State ( Southern Ireland ) and Northern Ireland . In the 1960s action kicked up again over problems of civil rights in Northern Ireland for the Catholics , a lot of the concerns were valid . A split developed in the IRA following the failed Border Campaign , that eneded in 1962 . The IRA split into two groups ; Provisional IRA ( PIRA or Provos ) , left wing socialsits and the more popular of the IRAs , when people refer to the IRA they often mean the PIRA . Official IRA ( OIRA ) , marxist and even further to the left to PIRA . In the 1980s the PIRA had another split ; PIRA Continuity Irish Republican Army ( CIRA ) this was over disagrements to not taking seats in the Republic of Ireland . PIRA made peace with the British in 1997 and this peace led to the Real IRA ( rIRA ) people who ca n't accpet the peace . Finally in 2012 a New IRA ( NIRA ) formed from all the splinter groups of the IRAs ( which is n't a lot of people ) . # WHY THE PIRA ARE UNLIKED The PIRA are unliked because they brought violence when people wanted peace , even in Northern Ireland they only had 13 % support ( Sinn Fein vote share in NI in the troubles ) . There was no need for the violence yet they brought it anyway . The PIRA had gang like control of Northern Ireland and were more like the Mafia than a liberation army . My Great Grandfather was made a refugue as he refused to pay the PIRA protection money . He was a Catholic Irish man from County Sligo who moved to County Derry . The PIRA were thugs . They targeted civilians and governemnt figures . # CORBYN AND THE PIRA Corbyn had a close relationship with the IRA , so close MI5 and MI6 ( British domestic and foreign secret service ) opened a case agaisnt him an spied on him , an elected member of Westminster under MI5 and MI6 investigation . After the Brighton Hotel Bombing , an attack that killed four tories including one MP and was the attempt by the IRA to kill the entire government of the UK , thankfully they failed . A few short weeks later Corbyn invited form prisoners who were PIRA into Parlaiment !

This is the reason being why Canada is still displayed as a part of the British Empire as they had control over all internal affairs , though couldnot control foreign ones .

{"question":"What are the biological consequences of cannibalism ? I just started watching hannibal and was wondering what eating human meat does to someones body . Any insight on that ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["As long as you avoid brain tissue , there is n't an issue . [ According to wikipedia , the biggest danger is weight gain . ] ( URL_0 ) > Prior to 1931 , New York Times reporter William Buehler Seabrook , allegedly in the interests of research , obtained from a hospital intern at the Sorbonne a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident , then cooked and ate it . He reported , \" It was like good , fully developed veal , not young , but not yet beef . It was very definitely like that , and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted . It was so nearly like good , fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary , normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal . It was mild , good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance , goat , high game , and pork have . The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal , a little stringy , but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible . The roast , from which I cut and ate a central slice , was tender , and in color , texture , smell as well as taste , strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know , veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable . The social consequences on the other hand are another matter entirely .","Oh I actually can provide some insight into this . Well for one have you ever noticed how dogs and cats do n't really tend to get sick when you get sick ? And vice versa ? Well when a disease makes a jump between species , particularly in the case of an animal to a human this process is called \" Zoonosis \" . This is also the process with which we believe humans first contracted HIV . It is believed that a similar virus called SIV ( Simian Immunodeficiency Virus ) made it 's first jump to humans somewhere in the Congo due to their proximity with the Simians(I believe they used them as a food source ? Correct me if I 'm wrong on that account , but they were DEFINITELY handling simian meat and being exposed to their blood frequently for whatever reason ) which in turn increased the opportunity for a jump to occur , and thus the likelihood that a jump would be successful . Now why is this relevant to cannibalism ? It is relevant because eating a member of your own species greatly increases the chances that in the event that your meal is diseased , you will also contract that disease . I believe an earlier comment mentioned Kuru disease which is actually closely linked to this idea . Meaning that you can only get Kuru if the thing you 're eating contains PrPsc ( a misfolded version of PrPc , PrPsc is the cause of Kuru ) , and the likelihood of the organism containing that misfolded protein goes way up if it 's a human . In the case of Kuru , cooking and preparation does NOT help . As the issue is a misfolded protein . Adding heat is n't going to re - nature the protein , and adding sufficient heat to destroy that protein is going to ruin your food . BUT in the majority of other cases disease is caused by micro - organisms , which CAN be treated by cooking , IF you do it properly . Which is n't a given , even nowadays where people STILL contract Salmonella from inadequately prepared food(strangely enough salad 's are the source of Salmonella in more cases than chicken is ) and the fact that it 's really hard to get every little pathogen in a given piece of meat dead without reducing the meal to something you would n't enjoy eating(like say ... ash ) . That being said , knowledge of how diseases spread and how to kill pathogens through heat is n't something we have known for a particularly long amount of time in human history . Thus those of our ancestors that engaged in this practice were typically at a higher risk on infection . Which if you choose to go with a Darwinian viewpoint meant they were less likely to survive and propagate the practice . You could make an argument that there 's also social gains to not eating each other or you enemies . Such as in the case of the Aztecs who were n't very well liked by their neighbors due to a combination of factors namely sacrifice of their neighbors and generalized aggression . But yeah if you can deal with all of those factors , you can for sure go ahead and chow down on a fellow member of your species . Then go to jail . :D","Mad cow disease , sort of , but in people .

{"question":"What is a microprocessor ? How does it work ? How was it invented ? My 7 - year - old niece is asking me these questions because she saw the word somewhere and someone told her that that 's what her iPad uses to work . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["The simplest microprocessor needs three things : a place to store some data ( memory ) ; a set of instructions to carry out on data ; and a working area in which to carry out the instructions . That 's it . * * data * * Data is always represented as a number . So even letters and instructions are numbers but we store some other data elsewhere that let 's the computer know ( I use this term loosely ) what letter or instruction is represented by a number by keeping them in a table somewhere else . All numbers in a computer are represented in binary . Binary is the series of ones and zeros you 've likely seen before . 01101001 . We do n't need a table to look up what these numbers mean because you can use maths to transfer from one to the other ( separate ELI5 question : how does binary work ) . We use binary because most microprocessors represent ones and zeros using a change in electrical voltage . Plus 5 volts and 0 volts are common but you can use any two voltages provided your equipment can tell the difference between the two . Each electrical voltage reading is called a bit . All of the data in the microprocessor is stored as electrical voltages in groups of 8 bits called a byte . More complex microprocessors deal with longer sets of bytes but for this example we 'll just use 8 bits , 1 byte . * * program in memory * * A program is read into memory and stored there . You can think of the program as a tape with a series of instructions on it and in between all of the instructions is some data . You start at one end of the tape and work to the other end unless an instruction on the tape tells you to jump forward or backwards along the tape . The tape can refer to memory locations . There 's lots of different memory locations in modern processors but all you need to know is that we can address them individually . * * instructions * * The simplest set of instructions would be the standard mathematical operators ( like add , subtract , divide and multiply ) and some instructions to jump to a particular part of the tape after some condition is met . * * example * * We write a program to subtract 1 from 10 until the value reaches 0 . In practice something like this can be used as a counter for another instruction being carried out 10 times . The language I am using here is a reduced assembly language from a computer game called TIS-100 . It 's a great way to learn how a processor works . It might be a bit advanced for your seven year old but if she seems to get the basic concepts it 's worth trying the game with her . I 'm pretty sure I started writing assembly about that age , I was certainly programming by then . ACC is the \" * * working area * * \" we talked about before . This is the tape MOV 10 ACC ( put the value 10 in the working area ) LOOP1 : ( this can be called anything but it 's a name used to jump in the code ) SUB 1 ( subtract 1 from the current value in ACC ) JNZ LOOP1 ( if the current value of ACC is not zero go back to loop otherwise do the next instruction ) * Next instruction * end of the tape . In memory it looks like this:(numbers down the side show moving forward in time ) ACC contents 00 : 00001010 ( number 10 ) 01 : 00001001 ( number 9 ) 02 : 00001000 ( number 8) 03 : 00000111 ( number 7 ) 04 : 00000110 ( number 6 ) 05 : 00000101 ( number 5 ) 06 : 00000100 ( number 4 ) 07 : 00000011 ( number 3 ) 08 : 00000010 ( number 2 ) 09 : 00000001 ( number 1 ) 10 : 00000000 ( number 0 ) And that 's it . It really is that simple . The reason everything seems complicated is that the computer can do millions of millions of these instructions every second and when you put them all together they can show a video or play music . It 's pretty incredible .","A few pretty good answers so far , but trying to answer this briefly and with ELI5 ( ELI7 ) in mind 1 ) a microprocessor is a basic computing unit that does things like addition , subtraction , condition evaluation ( e.g. is the result of the last subtraction equal to zero ) , reading inputs ( eg keyboard button presses ) , and writing to outputs ( eg pixels on a screen ) etc 2 ) it works by using combinations of simple logical operations like and , or , xor , and reading / writing inputs and outputs ( URL_0 ) 3 ) originally , microprocessors were used to perform very simple computations more quickly than humans could . They have been ever evolving over the past several decades for more and more advanced problem solving . For example , microprocessors have been used to drive calculators so people did n't have to do calculations by hand , but the same operations ( like addition , subtraction , reading and responding to keyboard inputs ) combined in innovative ways could also run simple games like pong . Then , taking it a step further , you could do things like determine what a person is typing and create a basic command line / user prompt application","A microprocessor -- also known as a CPU or central processing unit -- is a complete computation engine that is fabricated on a single chip . The first microprocessor was the Intel 4004 , introduced in 1971 . The 4004 was not very powerful -- all it could do was add and subtract , and it could only do that 4 bits at a time . But it was amazing that everything was on one chip . Prior to the 4004 , engineers built computers either from collections of chips or from discrete components ( transistors wired one at a time ) . The 4004 powered one of the first portable electronic calculators .

It looked much like a modern bicycle with two wheels of equivalent size , a frame , handle bars , and a seat between the two wheels . The penny - farthing eventually evolved because people realized that driving the wheel itself might be more advantageous . At this point , if you can glide on a running machine , it does n't take much more to drive pedals , you can already maintain balance . They used a gigantic wheel because machining and materials were not sophisticated enough to build chains and gearing , the large wheel allowed you to build appreciable speed . The style of bicycle of the penny - farthing is called a \" Standard \" bicycle . There was a strong desire to build a modern bicycle , called then a \" safety bicycle \" , because the standard was quite dangerous in a few scenarios - it had the inclination to pitch you forward and drive your face into the ground . The only thing that held it back was the gearing and chain mechanism , because small wheels under direct drive ca n't go fast .

{"question":"Why drill instructor in the army never stop screaming at recruit in the army ? What 's the point of screaming at people like that ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["> What 's the point of screaming at people like that ? It is intended to rattle the recruits mentally , making them feel like they are incapable and useless . The idea is to break their self - esteem and then the group will be given tasks where the support of the entire unit is necessary to succeed . To drive the point home they will often employ collective punishment so every recruit has an interest in making sure their peers succeed . All this has the goal of making the resulting soldiers psychologically dependent upon the military and their comrades . By creating this bond through surviving abuse it puts the soldiers in a better position to be confident in the support of their peers during combat , and for those peers to run into danger in the support of their comrades . Such a technique makes great soldiers . It also arguably seriously messes people up when they get out of the military because in essence they have been psychologically abused to foster a bond with the military culture .

{"question":"The seven deadly sins What do they mean ? Why are they deadly ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["The Seven Deadly Sins is a list of sins which are thought to be particularly bad . In particular , they lead on to other sins : for example , the deadly sin of lust might lead you to commit adultery or rape . They 're not in the Bible exactly , but various monks and clerics , including Pope Gregory I , drew up and refined this list over time . The Seven Deadly Sins are : 1 . Lust : an intense desire for something . It can be a sexual desire ( leading to , as I mentioned , other sexual sins ) , or desire for something abstract , like power ( leading to things like tyranny ) . 2 . Gluttony : consuming so much of something , that a lot of it goes to waste ; especially if it means that other people go without ( so from a Christian perspective , for example , the current situation where western societies have more food than they need while millions of people in other countries are starving would be a manifestation of the deadly sin of gluttony ) . 3 . Greed : the overwhelming desire to have material things , like money , and more than you need . In Dickens 's story * A Christmas Carol * , Ebenezer Scrooge was prone to this sin . It leads to other sins like trickery , theft , even more serious ones like murder . 4 . Sloth : this is when you just want the easy life and do n't want to accept responsibility for anything . It leads you to neglect your duties to God and the Church , but also to neglect your duties to other people -- so you might , for example , not bother to help people in need . If you live in a democracy and you do n't bother to register to vote , you might be said to be guilty of sloth . 5 . Wrath : absolute , total , all - consuming anger and hatred . Sometimes , anger is okay : for example , you might be angry at somebody murdering a child . But if your anger is directed against an innocent person , or if you call for what the American Constitution calls \" cruel and unusual punishment \" , then it becomes a sin . 6 . Envy : this is when you 're so jealous of what somebody else has that you want it yourself . For example , when King David saw Bathsheba sunbathing in the nude , he immediately became envious of her husband . Not only did this lead him to commit adultery with her , but he deliberately arranged her husband 's death . 7 . Pride : this is the most important of the Seven Deadly Sins , because it gives rise to all the other six . It 's more than just pride : it 's when you put your own needs above those of everybody else 's , an extreme form of selfishness . It also covers things like delusions of grandeur , or believing onself to be better than everyone else . So white supremecists , for example , are guilty of the sin of pride .","I believe what we 're missing when we think of the seven deadly sins are the seven virtues to combat it . Humility against pride . Kindness against envy . Abstinence against gluttony . Chastity against lust . Patience against anger . Liberality against greed . Diligence against sloth . These were taught side by side , but as with all things involving human nature , the negatives were accentuated and the positives were left behind somewhere on the road to Rome . Consider this the quick and dirty way to tell the people about God and religion without having to print Bibles . A verbal pamphlet , if you will . Take on the seven virtues and your way to heaven is assures . Take on the seven deadly sins and hell awaits .","Hello , Catholic priest here . . . In popular culture these are called the seven \" deadly \" sins , but in more informed contexts , they are called the seven \" capital \" sins ( or vices ) . They are called \" capital \" vices from the Latin word for \" head . \" They are heads in two different ( but related ) senses : 1 . Contrary to popular belief , they are not the most serious sins . Rather , they are the fundamental dispositions from which other sins follow . The capital sins are the most basic disordered dispositions that people tend to have . So for instance , the capital sin of wrath is less serious than murder , but wrath disposes a person for murder . Again , the capital sin of lust is less serious than adultery , but lust disposes a person for adultery . The idea is that uprooting sin is largely the task of uprooting the capital vices by practicing the virtues which are contrary to them . 2 . The capital vices provide a sort of classification system for a variety of other vices . The traditional list of \" capital vices \" was the product of a long process of evolution in the early Church . It reached its classical statement with Pope Gregory I ( and was elaborated on throughout the middle ages ) . For each of the seven capital vices , Gregory included a list of \" daughter vices \" which develop in a person when the capital vice goes unchecked . A list of these is here : URL_0 [ doc ] So , the general idea is that disordered love of self is the root of all vice and sin . This disordered love of self produces ( disordered ) desire of the flesh , desire of the eyes , and pride of life . ( cf . 1 Jn 2:16 ) . Disordered desire of the flesh gives rise to disordered desires for food and sex ( the capital vices of gluttony and lust ) . Disordered desire of the eyes gives rise to disordered desires for external goods ( which is the capital vice of covetousness ) . With respect to oneself , the pride of life engenders an inordinate desire for honor ( vainglory ) and an inordinate sadness at the arduousness of spiritual things ( sloth or \" acedia \" ) . With respect to others , the pride of life engenders an inordinate sadness at others ' honors ( envy ) or an attempt to lash out at others on account of them ( anger ) . Each capital vice engenders daughter vices when unchecked . So , for instance , unchecked envy begets hatred , tale - bearing , detraction , and morose delectation . Again , unchecked anger begets indignation , name - calling , etc ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The seven deadly sins are a list of behaviors that are considered to be very harmful or wrong.

The other , 3.3v , 5v and 12 volt ( and you are missing -12 volt ) are standardized voltage levels in electronics ( and thus computers ) and then specially transistors and all inherited technologies like digital chips : Digital chips ( IC 's , integrated circuits ) specially the TTL series have an \" low \" or 0 level at between 0.0 and 0.8 volts and a \" high \" or 1 level between 2 and 5 volts .

You do n't see 10V often because it is so close to 12V that most engineers would just design for 12V instead . For a long time 5V was the main standard for digital circuits . This was probably due to the introduction of 7400 series TTL ( transistor - transistor logic ) ICs in the early ' 60s . Later CMOS parts ( which are still widely used ) were made to be compatible . The 3.3 and lower voltages are now often used because high speed circuits can switch faster with lower voltages .","It depends on the power source . It is possible to send an insane amount of power even at very low voltage , but the physical design of the electronics would need to support huge amperages which would mean thicker circuits to cut down resistance . The higher the voltage though , the more power that can be sent at lower amperages . For instance a motor that needed to do a certain amount of work per minute might run at 3 volts and need 10 amps of power , but that same motor running at 6 volts might only need 5 amps of power . The amount of work done is the same , but the higher voltage allows for thinner wires to be used and smaller circuits since high amperage creates heat due to electrical resistances . Now that being said , suppose that the motor is in something that runs off AA batteries . 3 volts would require 2 AA batteries and would drain them very quickly , maybe even make them explode . But if you run it at 6 volts it will be easier to power but now it needs 4 AA batteries . Because each battery is 1.5 volts . So things which run on AA tend to be designed to use voltages in multiples of 1.5 volts . 3 volts , 4.5 , 6 , 7.5 , 9 , 10.5 , 12 volts etc . Things which run on Lithium batteries on the other hand are 3.7 to 4.2 volts a cell so they might run at voltages of 3.5 volts , 8 volts , 11.5 volts , etc . Suppose you design your circuit to run off of USB power which is very easy to use as a power source . Now you need to have a circuit which uses 5 volts and no more than 500 miliamps of power . You can use a power supply chip to convert that 5 volts to 12 volts but it will increase the miliamp draw and may push it over 500 . So you will want to design a circuit that runs well at low power , maybe even 3.3 volts which is a common voltage for integrated circuit chips , and use a power converter chip to take the 5v from USB and drop it down to 3.3 which will actually increase the amount of amps available since the voltage is dropping . Many devices in the 70 's and 80 's used 9 volt power supplies because 9 volt batteries are common . As we designed better chips and more efficient designs , we could get away with much lower voltages which allowed the use of higher capacity but lower voltage power sources like AA or AAA batteries . A 9 volt battery may have a lot of voltage but it has very little capacity so they run out quickly if you wanted to use them to drive a motor or something . So if you wanted to make an RC car you might have the motor run off of C or D cell batteries which were lower voltage but had a high capacity suitable for a power hungry motor . But the remote control on the other hand could operate more efficiently with a high voltage battery like a 9 volt but since there are no motors or anything in the controller it can run off a low capacity 9 volt just fine . 12 volts on the other hand is a good voltage to design around if your device is going to be used in an automobile . Since this became common eventually 12 volt power became a common lab voltage , which was incorporated into many power supplies in things like computers and radios . Because computers also needed lower voltage for the lower power circuits like memory and CPU , they also provided 5 volt and 3.3 volts all from the same power supply . When the USB standards were finalized they chose 5 volts because most computers already had a 5 volt supply available to power them . There are 3 factors at play for power . Voltage , Amps , and Watts . If you imagine electricity is water then voltage is the speed the water flows , amperage is how large the pipe is , and wattage is the total amount of water flowing per second . Say that you need to fill an 8 ounce glass of water . If you use a garden hose it 's pretty thick and moves a large amount of water ( amperage ) and the water comes out of the hose very quickly ( voltage ) filling the cup in just seconds . This would be high voltage and high amperage resulting in high wattage ( how much water per second flows into the cup ) . Now say you need to fill the cup with a hose the size of a spaghetti noodle . Since it 's so thin you would need to have the water move very fast or the cup is going to fill very slowly and takes 50 seconds to fill the glass . This is an example of high voltage and low amperage resulting in low wattage . You could fill the same glass with a kitchen faucet that moves water very slowly , but moves a lot of water at a time and fill the glass in 50 seconds and this would be an example of high amperage , low voltage . The 50 seconds to fill the glass would be the wattage . So you can see that high voltage , low amperage and low voltage , high amperage can both fill at the same rate , meaning the over all watts , or work done over time , can be the same . However the higher the voltage can go , the less the amperage is needed for the same amount of work . And the higher the amperage available , the less voltage is needed to do the same amount of work . Since high amperage creates a lot of heat and is very hard on batteries , sometimes it makes sense to go with a higher voltage because it 's easier to make use of that power . If you went with low voltage , you could still do a lot of work with it , but you would need very high amperage batteries and parts that can withstand the heat that would produce ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Electronics require specific voltages because different components are designed to work with specific voltage ranges.

There are other patterns assigned to non - commercial broadcasters like amateur radio operators , satellite uplink stations , and radio repeaters . Technically a station can have as many as seven letters in their call letters , but that 's rare and only used for specialty transmitters .","EDIT : Flipped W / K and East / West for some reason . Thanks u / Sjsoektbbfjfkd ! By around 1910 the use of radio in the USA was becoming common enough that Congress passed its first laws to regulate its use . Tellingly , this was the \" Wireless Ship Act of 1910 , \" as naval communications was the most critical purpose of radio technology , and the primary purpose of this act was to require ships of certain size to have wireless sets for emergency and other operational purposes . The Radio Act of 1912 ( a response to the sinking of the Titanic ) bolstered the above law , and began the practice of licensing individual transmitters , assigning individuals or companies responsibilities based on that license , limiting frequencies and power levels and other technical aspects , and assigning unique call signs . But what should a call sign look like ? Well , a series of international commissions on radio ( referred to at the time as \" International Radiotelegraphic Conferences \" ) developed an international system of call signs , granting each nation a block of them . The standard at the time was usually 3 letters , A - Z - a total of 17,576 possible stations , although longer call signs existed ( or would shortly ) . The USA had already been using call signs starting with N ( common starting letter for US Navy stations ) , so it got the assignement of every radio station starting with N and a subset of stations starting with AA through AL ( for America , presumably , although they had to share about half the possible A - stations ) . Some of the IRC ( later ITU ) assignments made sense - Russia got R , France F , Italy I , Great Britain G. To allow for the fact some nations needed a lot of call signs due to their population and level of technical development , some nations got letters that were pretty much randomly assigned : China got B , Great Britain got M in addition to G , and the USA got W and K along with N. Various other nations received only portions of blocks . ( EDIT : These are really post - WWI assignments ; the ELI5 is complicated enough without explaining how the US 's call sign blocks changed over decades of IRC / ITU agreements . ) So , that 's US stations available to assign as of ~~1912~~ 1920 - some of the A block ( America ) , all the N block ( Navy ) and W and K ( because nobody else wanted those letters badly enough to fight for them ) . The US decided to reserve AA - AL and N for government use , leaving K and W for non - government licenses . ~~The next step is obvious , right ? Give W to the Western USA and keep K for the Eastern USA , ( K is kinda close to E ... ).~~ ~~Nope ! No such rule existed ; K - stations and W - stations were granted all over the USA , which is why you have WBZ Boston ( licensed 1921 ) and KJR Seattle ( licensed 1922 ) and various other outliers.~~ EDIT : W and K stations were initially not geographically linked , with the Eastern US having a fair mix of both , but around 1912 ( ? ) it was decided to split them , with K in the West and W in the East . The dividing line was initially the Western border of the Dakotas , Nebraska , Kansas , Oklahoma , and Texas . This shifted to the Mississippi River in 1923 . For this reason , you have still - existing stations like KYW Pittsburgh ( licensed 1921 ) and WKY Oklahoma City ( licensed 1922 ) . Regulations up to that point had focused on radio as a 2 - way communications tool , but the development of practical microphones , speakers , and home radio receivers right around 1920 suddenly created a demand for a totally new type of radio - broadcast radio - where a single ( very powerful ) station transmitted news , entertainment , and other information , many hours a day , many days a week . Existing US regulations were n't prepared for hundreds of such transmitters popping up all over the place in the space of a few years , and needed a lot more resources and better organization to handle the fact a device designed for transmitting short messages between places was suddenly a font for popular media . By 1922 , 3 - letter K and W call signs had been more or less used up , and future broadcast licenses were 4 letters , and often longer for amateur and other - purposed stations .

Why would Disney allow Universal to continue making money off their own property ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Because those rides and characters were purchased by Universal before Disney made deals with Marvel . Disney did not get the rights to those things when they got Marvel .","Back in the 1990s , long before Marvel was acquired by Disney , they signed an impressively tight contract with Universal for the rights to the characters in use within theme park attractions . The contract limits the use of the characters on the east coast of the country to Universal Orlando with even tighter restrictions within a 60 - mile radius of the Orlando parks . The contract does have a few stipulations , like ensuring upkeep of the rides , but overall is definitely more favorable to Universal than Marvel . Since that initial contract , Disney has bought Marvel , pumped millions of dollars into it and made it one of the most popular brands in modern film history . With billions of dollars in sales annually Marvel has proven to be a cash cow for Disney . The company , long known for its theme parks tie - ins , has already announced a ride in Hong Kong along with a small exhibit at Disneyland in California . While Marvel is slowly but surely being rolled out into the Disney parks globally back here in Florida , that airtight contract from the 1990s still blocks them from building anything at their most popular resort complex .

{"question":"Hacking , and what the process actually would look like Whenever I envision hacking I just see someone at their computer mashing away at the keyboard , but what actually IS hacking ? How does one do it ? What does one use ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Hacking , fundamentally , is to force a system to operate outside of its intended parameters . Even if the term is most widely used for breaking into someone else 's computer system , using the term in non - malicious and benign situations is perfectly valid . When talking about computer security , using the term \" hacking \" as described above , can be seen as forcing a system that 's intended to be secure to behave outside of intended parameters as well . That would mean it 's no longer a secure system . The system has been compromised . To \" hack \" a computer system involves ( among other things ) writing code that specifically targets vulnerabilities in the system 's software or hardware . By exposing a system to a situation it is n't capable of handling , you can cause the system to partially break down and start doing things it should n't be doing . \" All \" software is designed to handle a lot of unintended situations . A program that adds together two numbers and stores the result in a space that can only hold 3 digits might have code that makes it double - check that the result is n't 4 or more digits before it tries to write it , for example . If it gets a result that ends up bigger than 3 digits , it 'll stop before doing something illegal . When a hacker tries to attack a system , they try to find the errors that a program * does n't * know how to handle properly , and then cause it to perform an action that causes this error . Then they attempt to cause this error to change things in the system that allow for even greater changes , hopefully a change that would allow them to gain full control of the system . When a \" patch \" comes out for a program , this may be the creator of the program changing the problem that the hacker found . After the patch is applied , the hacker now needs to look for a different weakness in the program , which the creator of the program again will have to fix with a new patch . As you can see , this is basically an arms race . More and more sophisticated attacks being launched at more and more robust software . As for what 's used , sometimes , it 's analyzing traffic coming in and out of a system , looking for patterns or anomalities . Other times , it can be going through a program 's source code , attemting to find portions of code that would be vulnerable . The \" hacks \" themselves are often performed with an array of viruses , malware , etc . that is sent to a system . These are written with text editors that are optimized for coding or with software engineering tools similar or the same as what \" nice \" coders use . Then there is also social engineering , which is is n't as much hacking a computer system , as it is to trick the users of it . If you can fool a user into giving you their password , you do n't need to attack their system directly with malware or viruses . This is what often is the case when someone on social media says they 've \" been hacked \" . Usually , they 've been lead to believe they were using the real website of a service when they entered their login information , while they in reality were not . Once they 've done this , criminals can often figure out the username and passwords for other sites this person uses , because a * lot * of users reuse passwords across sites and apps . Social engineering is often used in conjunction with more technical attacks . If you can trick an employee into giving you their login info , you can use this to plant malware that would n't have been able to penetrate a company 's network from the outside . However , if the malware was planted * inside * the company 's network instead , by a compromised employee 's account , it could work .","Hello u / PM_ME_YAOI _ it seems that your reddit subscription expired .

Trump and Bannon do n't care if that particular ban was overturned ( they can always try to make another one , though every subsequent effort is tainted by their previous attempt ) . They care about the principle underneath : may a president exclude people solely on the basis of national origin or religion ? If so , then that increases the president 's power . Trump ( and other conservatives ) like this idea . Also , spite . Trump hates losing . Law student talk below , feel free to skip : Basically , when you have a law that divides people up for any reason , it 's possible it might be challenged under the 5th Amendment ( for federal laws ) or the 14th Amendment ( for state laws ) . With a few exceptions I 'll get into , most of the time the law will stand , provided that a \" rational basis \" for the law can be articulated . So say I pass a law that says all current and former Bronies are forbidden from marrying . The rational basis has to be at least somewhat linked to the purpose of the law and what it does : I ca n't claim that preventing Bronies from marrying is for the good of the environment , for example . And if my actions indicate animus towards the class I 'm discriminating against ( like , say , I give a lot of speeches about how much I hate Bronies ) , it taints any reasonable arguments I might have in favor of the law . The exceptions to this are certain protected classes , including religion , race , and national origin . In those cases , the government must prove that the law serves an important government interest and that it 's the least intrusive method possible . Trump 's travel ban is ostensibly neutral : he 's banning countries , not religions . His purported , rational basis for this is vetting , and his purported government interest is national security . This argument is weakened by both the fact that the US already has the most extensive vetting process in the world and by the fact that he 's straight - out said Islamophobic and racist things : the \" animus \" that kills rational basis . But it 's possible that , on balance , the court might find the interest * so * compelling that they rule that way .

{"question":"Ayn Rands Philosophy and why it 's frowned upon I have read The Fountainhead and I really enjoyed it . Also , I think her points were pretty good but maybe I did n't get it . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["I was drawn in by the Fountainhead as well when I was 18 or 19 . It makes basic sense the idea that each person should just take care of themselves and everyone would be fine . About a year after I read the Fountainhead I read Atlas shrugged . Longer story but same basic principles apply . As I became an adult I began to get some cognitive dissonance over some of the things that we practiced and preached in there . Probably the biggest problem I have with her philosophy now is that it assumes that a free - market will allow the good businesses to drown out or quash the bad businesses or the cheating businesses . Reality is far from that . In fact it 's quite the opposite . The cheating bad business collude to drown out the good players . You 're left with fixed markets in little choice for the consumers . Also I began to realize that it 's actually smart for society as a whole to put aside some money to take care of those that need help for example Health insurance . And the older I got the more I realized that we are not just a bunch of individuals . While we are all unique we also all share a common thread . We do n't only need to act individually but also as a collective for the betterment of all of us . It did n't help that I found out that Ayn Rand happily accepted social security benefits . Also , to understand how she came up with these concepts that helps to understand where she came from . She came from pre - Revolution in Russia . Unlike most people , her family was doing very well under czarist Russia . The Russian revolution happened when she was a young girl and her family fled Russia . Understandably she was affected by this and it came to shape her reasoning . If you study her at all you 'll find out that she seemingly had some pretty major issues . If you were going to be on her team or on her side you had to agree with her on everything if you disagreed over even the smallest point you were out . Lastly , finding out she idolized serial killer William Edward Hickman did it for me . I realized she was really just a woman with some problems with a world view shaped by her childhood . Also , as I got older I realized the guys that idolized her are so often know - it - all guys that so very often have little or no experience with women or raising kids but claim to know how everyone should be . Turns out I 'm just too compassionate and close to normal to remain a Rand - er . URL_0","Ayn Rand 's views are completely contrary to my own ( personally I think she was a sociopath ) , but I 've read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged . I enjoyed the Fountainhead as well , despite my political views , simply because it 's a good story with fairly compelling characters . Atlas Shrugged is more of a manifesto on her philosophy , which is essentially just pure selfishness . She believes that altruism , i.e. helping others , is evil . And that the only moral thing a person can do is care only for their own desires . It 's frowned upon because that 's the opinion of , at best , a very unpleasant person , and at worst , a dangerous psychopath . Atlas Shrugged is much more unabashed in displaying this ideology , so you should read that too to understand why she is frowned upon , because The Fountainhead is n't quite as ... aggressive .","It attracted me as a high school student . I was an angst - ridden valedictorian who found myself validated by her characters . When I went to college and studied philosophy and religion more in depth , I quickly abandoned her ideas . She 's fun to read but lacks the depth of other philosophers , and her philosophy has some gaping holes in it . A few examples of why philosophers typically ignore her : * Her philosophy only touches on politics and ethics but ignores the essential building blocks that most others use to get there : her system is fun but intellectually shallow . For instance , Kant offers ethics and political ideas like Ayn Rand , but he also overturns how we understand understanding itself in his \" Critique of Pure Reason \" . Kant gets you to ethics by pointing out the difficulty of understanding things - as - they - are - in - themselves ( his work on this is a real mindfuck when you get deep into it ) , whereas Ayn gets you there by saying \" Would n't it be nice if people were fully and only rational and self - serving ? \" Her system is weaker because her foundations are less basic , less primal , and rely on shallower foundations than others . * Ayn Rand 's ideas require perfectly rational and philosophically consistent people , and those do n't exist . It 's why pure communism fails beyond the small scale . All people are imperfect humans and make dumb , irrational decisions . The first Bioshock video game even offers an Ayn Randian dystopia , where everything goes horribly awry because ( surprise ) , people are n't truly rational and ethically consistent . * Ayn Rand 's system does little to overcome the [ tragedy of the commons ] ( URL_0 ) , which is a major problem of politics and economics . Her system fails because she incorrectly assumes rational self - interest will sort out all problems , but the tragedy of the commons is all about situations and times when rational self - interest is leads to undesirable outcomes or even self - destruction . Her system by - and - large can not overcome this existential problem that faces every community in the long run . * She largely rejects government welfare programs as mooching , but that 's more her ex - Soviet background speaking than anything else . The majority of homeless people in my home county were there due to unforeseeable medical emergencies but were previously major assets to the community . Under Rand 's system , too bad so sad : get a loan , hope someone 's self - interest leads them to be charitable , or die in the streets . Under a good social safety net , you hit a rough patch , are freely supported for a bit by the community , and then return to normal life and contributing to society . Also , think about this : robots have replaced factory workers , are slowly replacing drivers and accountants , and are close to outsmarting human doctors now too . Under Rand 's system , the advancement of robotics would leave the vast majority of humans destitute , leading to civil unrest and wars , which again is unhealthy and unhelpful for a functioning human society . * Ayn Rand 's novels celebrate geniuses who would succeed in fair competitions , but even if there were no governments , Howard Roark and friends could still be stomped by unscrupulous corporations . Life and people are n't fair : humans are not only often dumb and inconsistent but also major jerks . Nikolai Tesla was arguably smarter than and had the better electricity system compared to Thomas Edison , but Edison manipulated people to try to discredit and destroy the superior electricity system . The oil barons of the early 1900s did even crazier things to destroy their rivals , and they did a lot of it purely on their own by manipulating market forces and people 's self - interest , no governments necessary . Now rather than rival inventors or old - timey oil barons , imagine you start up a brilliant new website in a world where no government exists to defend net neutrality . Comcast would steal your idea and restrict traffic to your website until you gave up , sold the rights to them for cheap , and went home broke . People are dicks and abuse their power , with or without government intervention , and again , Ayn Rand 's system fails to prevent Comcast from dicking you and your startup company over . * EDIT : Stealing from the stack - exchange post , which is one of the best replies here , Rand also does n't meet the philosophical standards of today 's two major intellectual camps . Analytic philosophy prefers \" If A and B , then C unless D \" kinds of discussions of very specific questions , while the Continental school favors broader and more comprehensive / holistic discussions ( I 'm really weak with Continental philosophy , so I ca n't explain it well ) . She does n't do either Analytic or Continental well and does n't fully engage with other philosophers in a real way , mostly because she primarily advocates her ideas via stories and proverbs rather than via full and honest argumentation against rival philosophers . * There are certainly more problems with her philosophy than listed here , and it 's been years since I 've read her books , so I may have a few things wrong here . The crux of my objections is that her books are a fun read but not really that intellectually sustainable when you start stacking her up against other philosophers . My advice ? Go read Plato 's \" Republic \" , Aristotle 's \" Nicomachaen Ethics \" , Adam Smith 's utilitarian ethics , Kant 's deontological ethics , Reinhold Niebuhr 's \" Moral Man , Immoral Society \" , some modern analytic philosophy essays , and a few other big - name philosophers of your choice for good measure . Then you 'll probably start to see why Ayn Rand is looked down upon ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Ayn Rand was a philosopher and writer who developed a philosophical system called \"Objectivism.\" Objectivism is based on the idea that reality is objective and independent of our minds, and that reason is the only reliable way to gain knowledge. According to Rand, the proper moral code is one that promotes individual rights and individual freedom.\\n\\nRand's philosophy has been controversial and has received criticism from many different quarters. Some people argue that her ideas about individualism and capitalism are overly simplistic and ignore the complex social and economic realities of the world. Others argue that her ideas about morality are overly selfish and ignore the importance of compassion and concern for others.\\n\\nOverall, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they agree with Rand's philosophy.

So i hard coded it at 80F. I would have to recode with s different upper limit and recompile the new program if that 's what you want . Or you could provide me a requirement in which the upper limit shall be configurable by thr user without the need to recompile thr code . In that case i would not hard code s direct value as the upper limit , but provide an interface to allow the user to change a variable that is used at the upper limit .

Ideally you should assume nothing and take your cues from the system environment and put all the stuff that might need to be changed at some point in something like an external easily editable configuration file .

The worst case scenario is that something you thought would never change does change and you have to now recompile the program or try to attack it with a hex - editor to make the necessary changes if you do n't have access to the source code . To give an example : You might have a program that wants to save certain files to some place on your disk . Ideally it should ask the users where to put them or ask the OS where such files are normally put or make assumptions about where to put them but have a config file where the users can change the path if necessary . If the developer was bad at their job they just assumed where the files should be put and hard coded that value in the program itself .

As such , if you wish to modify said behavior , you have to change source code and compile this source code yourself . An alternate way of doing things is to make the behavior parameter - based . Say , if you draw a cursor , and want to change its color , if it 's hard - coded , you have to recompile the entire operating system . But if you make the operating system , say , look at cursor-color.txt and if it sees ' red ' , draw cursor red , then you could modify the cursor color just by changing that one text file .

{"question":"How do modern mercenaries operate ? It sounds like something illegal to me , but they do exist . How do mercenary organisations form , where do they come from and how are they hired ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Ha , something I can answer , my thesis for my bachelor of political science is completely on Dutch private military companies . In the current scientific terminology mercenaries are actually defined as contractors , calling them mercenaries was considered pretty old fashioned by the private military company directors I interviewed . Contractors are defined as military personnel that do not work directly for a government but for a company . A lot of states , especially the US , have started to use these companies a lot over the last decades . In 2007 for example 54 % of US defense personnel in Afghanistan were contractors and not US state troops . Contractors are deployed in a myriad of ways , they fight shoulder to shoulder with American soldiers in the front line but also protect vips or convoys , protect the outer rings of camps or support armies in logistical ways by flying planes or helicopters with vital supplies . They also guard merchant vessels in for example the Gulf of Aden and they help companies that have to deal with kidnappings of personnel in Africa . Contractors have advantages over normal troops in some situations . They are often cheaper to deploy than army equivalents . You do not want elite troops guarding the outer rings of camps in low intensity areas , so it is preferable for states to hire cheap third country contractors to do these relatively simple tasks so that the regular troops do not have to waste their time on patrol duties and can do actual missions . There is some criticisms on this system as some argue that companies should not partake in the monopoly of the use of legal force . This monopoly is the idea that only the state can legally detain you or punish you using force . Now there are companies do basically the same . Fighting wars for states makes it legal for them to kill people sometimes largely to their own discretion . The academic and philosophical debate on whether companies should be allowed to partake in this monopoly on the use of legal force is still raging and something we will have to tackle in the coming decades as the use of private military companies is on the rise . I hope I gave a quick am understandable overview of what pmcs do , I am sadly not with my computer so I ca n't give references for my sources , but if you want to learn more about pmcs authors like Tonkin and Leander are great sources to learn more about this emerging issue .","They are typically formed by ex - military or police officers and are hired just like any other company : you 'd sign a contract with them . Naturally , they do n't use the term \" mercenary \" preferring the more subtle term , \" security services . \" You would not hire these companies as an army to fight a war though . Typically they would be contracted for personal security and to train an existing group of men , turning them into soldiers . They would also offer strategic counsel and probably have sources for supplying arms .","Mercenaries are just companies that provide people who do work . Swiss mercenaries ( employed by the vatican in an official capacity to guard the pope ) are essentially an officially endorsed state sponsored mercenary arrangement . Nepalese Gurkhas who fight for the British army are something similar . But wholly private mercenaries basically grow out of some former soldier or someone with diplomatic and military connections who can hire people who are going to fight . Ghaddafi hired chadian mercenaries essentially straight out of want ads in , well , chad . Mark Thatcher ( son of former UK Prime minister Margaret ) got into the business through Simon Mann , a former British army officer who was contracted by the Angolan government to provide military services retaking an oil field . The legality of mercenaries is sort of all over the place . If the government of a country hires you to to do work for them , in their own country then presumably the work is by definition legal , at least in the sense that you took a contract you understood to be legal . Using a mercenary force against another country is n't at all obvious when it is or is n't legal . In the case of say , colonial efforts by the americans in Iraq , well , private contractors delivering supplies etc . need guards , so are those guys mercenaries ? ( Yes , but not necessarily ) . If you want to pay some French or Americans or whatever to come to your country and train your army that is presumably legal . But if you want to pay them to come and train your insurgent force to take over the country that usually is n't . Keep in mind that many countries , particularly in Africa and the Middle East have pathetically small armies , that have almost no equipment , no combat experience , no competent leadership , and generally ca n't be trusted to actually fight , or if they do , probably not win . Those countries rely on foreign specialists for their fighting and training needs because they ca n't be bothered to train their own forces for the relatively rare event that they need them . So long as they are fighting non sovereign states ( so pirates , gangs , insurgents , even ISIS ) mercenaries are generally desirable . The situation against ISIS is a fairly good example of why you might need mercenaries . If you do n't trust your own army to not defect , you have a problem ( Syria and Saudi have this problem ) . If you think your army is going to turn and run at the first sign of trouble you have a problem ( the Iraqi 's have this problem ) . If your army refuses to fight during Ramadan , you have a problem . Mercenaries let you overcome a lot of that . Also , Mercenaries , are essentially outside the geneva conventions , they are not considered combatants and not entitled to geneva convention protections explicitly . For that reason they have no motivation to adhere to geneva conventions , and if you intend to do something illegal some mercenaries are happy to torture and stage coups etc , because it ca n't get any worse for them if they are caught and taken prisoner ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Mercenaries are people who are paid to fight or work for a country or organization that is not their own.

Now let 's suppose that you want to find only the marbles that weight between 18 grams and 20 grams . Of course , we do n't want to do this by hand since we have a lot of marbles so instead what we 'll do is make something that can make the decision for us . In this case , we create a path by cutting a groove into a piece of wood that all of the marbles can fit down . Now , we put in a trap door that only marbles that weight 18 grams or more can fall through and into a new path . We 're half way there ! Now the problem is that the marbles that are too heavy will fall through so we need another trapdoor to only catch the marbles that weigh 21 grams but allow the others to flow through into a bucket at the end of the path . This bucket will now contain only marbles weighing between 18 and 20 grams . We would test it by having a test set of marbles where only red ones should end up in the bucket and any other color is incorrect . After the testing , we would make adjustments to the trapdoors so that only the correct marbles get through . This is called training . So , in computers , machine learning is exactly this where the trapdoors are nodes that have certain weights applied to them . If the input passes a certain threshold ( the marble is in the right weight range ) , then the node passes the value onto a certain pathway for further execution . If we find out that the output is n't what correct , then we go back in and work on the nodes / weighting ( trapdoors ) so that it works with values that we know to be correct . This is a very broad topic and this is a super simplified answer which I hope clarifies it for you .","There are two broad categories for AI : Decision problems and search / optimization problems . Examples of decision problems : * Given this state of a chess game , which of the available moves should white make ? * Given this huge body of medical data and this patient 's symptoms , what diseases is he likely to have ? * Given this huge body of historical weather data and the current weather , what 's the weather going to be tomorrow ? There are a lot of different systems that are used to try to make these decisions . For games with turns , like chess , it 's usually based around evaluating the state of the game at each move to give a score for each player , exploring all of the possible paths the game could take , and choosing the move that maximizes the score . For things like the medical example , imagine picking two types of data and plotting them in a scatterplot . For example , age on one axis and BMI on the other .

In his later life he became somewhat of a catholic apologist , although a kind of heretical one , which succeeded in pissing off a lot of people . But he started his career with a fairly scientific / analytical approach towards trying to understand why some myths \" took \" , while others did not . I.e. , why did thousands or millions of people fight and die for this or that idea , and not for this other one . At the core of his theories is a hypothesis that human societies require an enemy and scapegoat , and periodic sacrifice . I.e. , that human organizations are held together by unification against external threat , and by someone to blame for whatever is wrong . He presents no small amount of evidence in support of this theory , from all kinds of primitive and early - historical societies , and ties it into his larger theories of mimetic desire , which gets a lot more complicated . Skipping over a lot of stuff , Girard theorized that the Christ - myth was unique in making the scapegoat / enemy also the deity , and thereby * exposing * the mechanism of outward enemy as unifying force , and allowing for new , more sophisticated social structures that did not require opposition , conquest , or war against external tribes , cultures , or supernatural forces . To grossly over - simplify , Girard saw \" primitive \" religions as those which imagined vengeful , jealous , capricious gods , who demanded subservience and sacrifice , like a supernatural \" boss \" or \" big man \" . Judaism , uniquely among ancient religions , in his view , had a deity which required not just prescriptive behaviors and sacrifices , but also recognized nuances of intention and desires . The Jewish God not only forbade taking another man 's wife , he forbade even thinking about or desiring it . In Gerard 's system , societies always need a sacrificial scapegoat . If they can not find an external one , they will find an internal one . This mechanism enforces tribalism and small networks . The theory is that the Christ - myth exposes the need to scapegoat , and provides a universal scapegoat , and negates the need for constant supply of new sacrificial victims , by making the deity himself the universal victim . We all killed God , we are all the enemy of God , and yet he forgives us , and dies for us whenever we sin . The barbarian at the gates is ourselves , and we can not defeat the enemy except by being better .","The Jewish religion was based around the idea of sacrifice : if you did something wrong , you had to pay for it . You would take a sacrifice to the temple -- depending on how much you had and what you had done wrong , this might be some grain , or perhaps a couple of birds , or something bigger like a lamb or an ox . The idea was that you had to make amends . If the sacrifice you brought was a live animal , it was slaughtered . In those days , people believed that the life of an animal was contained in its blood ( not surprising , given that if you bleed a lot you can die ) , so it was the blood that somehow made everything work and got you forgiveness from God . Sacrifices were made on other occasions , too . One of the most important was the festival of Passover , when Jews would slaughter and eat lambs . This goes back to the story of the Exodus , when the Israelites escaped slavery in Egypt : according to the legend , God sent the Angel of Death to kill all the Egyptians ' first - born sons , but the Israelites smeared the blood of slaughted lambs on their doorposts so the angel would spare them . Fast - forward to the time of Jesus . According to the Bible , he said some nasty things about the religious authorities , saying that they were exploiting ordinary people . He suggested that there was no need to make sacrifices : God would forgive you anyway . The religious authorities did n't like that , so plotted to have him killed . Of the four Gospels , two of them say he died the day after the Passover , and one ( John ) says he died at the very moment the Passover lambs were being slaughtered . A bit later , St. Paul joined the movement Jesus had started , and developed a theory about Jesus 's death and why it was necessary . Blood , he said , was necessary for the forgiveness of sins . Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice : as he was \" the son of God \" ( however you interpret that phrase ) , his blood was enough to grant forgiveness for us all . There was no need to bring any sacrifices to the temple , and no need to convert to Judaism . It seems a bit weird to us now , but that 's because we 're not used to a sacrificial cult . It was really St Paul 's attempt to give Jesus 's death some kind of symbolic meaning ."],"chatgpt_answers":["According to the Bible, Jesus was the Son of God who came to Earth as a human being to save humanity from their sins.

Your nerve cells work by receiving a stimulus , which if strong enough activates channels in the cell to allow in positively charged atoms ( ions ) . The cell is naturally negative , so the ions rush in , creating a positive charge that triggers channels further down the cell , sending a charged impulse until an action by the cell is triggered . If the cell is continually triggered , this might cause the cell to allow negatively charged ions to flow in . This makes it harder to send the positively charged impulse . It requires a greater stimulus . Therefore your brain becomes unaware of the smells because the nerve impulses from your nose to your brain are no longer being sent .","When you constantly smell something , your brain gets desensitized to the smell .

When you first smell something, your brain is able to fully detect and recognize the scent. However, as you continue to be exposed to the same smell, your brain becomes less sensitive to it and you may no longer be able to detect it as easily.\\n\\nThere are several reasons why this happens. First, your nose has special cells called olfactory receptors that are responsible for detecting smells. These cells can become tired or fatigued if they are constantly being stimulated by the same smell, leading to a decrease in sensitivity. Second, your brain has a built-in mechanism to filter out familiar or constant smells in order to focus on new or important smells. This helps you to better detect changes or dangers in your environment.\\n\\nTo reverse noseblindness, you can try taking a break from the smell or exposing yourself to a variety of different smells. For example, if you live in a house with strong cooking smells, you could open the windows or go outside for a while to allow your nose to reset. You can also try smelling different things, such as essential oils or scented candles, to give your olfactory receptors a break from the constant stimulation.\\n\\nIn general, it is a good idea to periodically expose yourself to new and different smells, as this can help to keep your sense of smell sharp and sensitive.

The reason this is so important is because they may give you a decent price on your trade - in but then increase the price of the new vehicle to recover that money , or vice versa . Many dealerships will ask you at the beginning of the negotiation whether you have a trade in and you should feel free to say no even if that 's not really truthful because trust me , they do n't have any problem lying to you .

There are a few reasons why USB, HDMI, and other types of connectors are not designed so that there is only one way to insert them.\\n\\nFirst, it would be difficult to design a connector that could only be inserted in one way and still be flexible enough to fit into a wide range of devices. For example, some devices may have ports that are oriented vertically, while others may have ports that are oriented horizontally. In order to accommodate these different orientations, the connector would need to be able to bend or twist in various directions. This would be difficult to achieve if the connector could only be inserted in one way.\\n\\nSecond, having connectors that can be inserted in either direction can make it easier for people to use devices. For example, if you are trying to plug in a USB cable and the connector is oriented the wrong way, you can simply flip it over and try again. This saves you the time and frustration of having to unplug and then reinsert the connector in the correct orientation.\\n\\nFinally, it is generally not cost-prohibitive to design connectors that can be inserted in either direction. In fact, the cost of designing and manufacturing connectors that can only be inserted in one way may be significantly higher than the cost of designing and manufacturing connectors that can be inserted in either direction.\\n\\nI hope this helps to explain why USB and HDMI connectors are not designed so that there is only one way to insert them.

{"question":"When ZIP files are compressed , they remove redundant information , why ca n't this be done for all files ? Why ca n't we just store all files on our computers like how ZIP files are compressed ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["If every file was compressed then every file would have to be decompressed every time it is used ( and re - compressed every time it is saved ) . Zipping and unzipping files uses a decent amount of processing power , and today 's computers can store a lot of data where it makes more sense to just store the uncompressed version of the file since space is quite abundant and easily added to computers . Program files especially are often being accessed and modified frequently , it 'd be too much CPU workload if files were always being zipped and unzipped . If we 're just talking about things like a Microsoft Word file and stuff , then if you really want to save space on your computer you can zip all of those . But I do n't see this being a realistic scenario . This is similar to WAV music files . They are much larger than MP3 and other formats ( and can be way better quality ) but they use less processing power to play . This is why some video games like Titanfall use all uncompressed music files , because they did n't want the processor working to decompress them during the game . This contributed to Titanfall 's large size on the hard drive .","It can be done for all files . For example in windows 7 : Open windows explorer ( windows key + E will do it ) Right click on the drive Select \" Properties \" Click the checkbox that says \" Compress this drive to save space \" .

{"question":"The USA military ranking system . I just finished watching band of brothers and I 'm curious what ranks there are and how long it would take to reach them . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["So Band of Brothers was set in WW2 , where the ranks for the military were a bit different than today ( where they have been standardized ) . Promotions back then , due to the massive expansion of the military , happened a lot quicker : it was possible for people to reach Colonel ( O-6 ) in their late 20 's , simply because there was space in front of them / they needed one / the guy in front of him got killed . An example in Band of Brothers is Major Winters : he went from 2nd Lieutenant in 1942 after commissioning from OCS , was a 1st Lieutenant on D - Day , got promoted to Captain on July 1st , 1944 , then was a Major . In today 's military , you have two years as a 2nd Lieutenant , followed by 2 years as a 1st Lieutenant , followed by 4 - 6 years as a Captain . Those ranks are mostly automatic - starting with Major , however , you face a promotion board , and if you are passed over for promotion twice from here on out , you essentially are out ( you ca n't be promoted essentially - if you make O-4 though , you are eligible for retirement and can stay in to hit 20 years ) . As far as the ranks go : * * Enlisted * * Pay Grade | Army | Marine Corps | Air Force | Navy / Coast Guard -- | -- | -- | -- | -- E-1 | Private | Private | Recruit | Seaman Recruit E-2 | Private | Private First Class | Airman | Seaman Apprentice E-3 | Private First Class | Lance Corporal | Airman First Class | Seaman E-4 | Corporal / Specialist | Corporal | Senior Airman | Petty Officer , 3rd Class E-5 | Sergeant | Sergeant | Staff Sergeant | Petty Officer , 2nd Class E-6| Staff Sergeant | Staff Sergeant | Technical Sergeant | Petty Officer , 1st Class E-7 | Sergeant First Class | Gunnery Sergeant | Master Sergeant | Chief Petty Officer E-8 | First Sergeant / Master Sergeant | First Sergeant / Master Sergeant | Senior Master Sergeant | Senior Chief Petty Officer E-9 | Sergeant Major | Sergeant Major / Master Gunnery Sergeant | Chief Master Sergeant | Master Chief Petty Officer As you can see , the Navy / Coast Guard are identical , the Army / Marines are pretty similar , and the Air Force ... who knows why the Air Force feels the need to be different but you do you I guess * * Warrant Officers * * Pay Grade | Rank -- | -- W-1 | Warrant Officer ( Army / Marines only ) W-2 | Chief Warrant Officer 2 W-3 | Chief Warrant Officer 3 W-4 | Chief Warrant Officer 4 W-5 | Chief Warrant Officer 5 Note that the Air Force has NO warrant officers , while the Navy / Coast Guard do not have a W-1 rank . * * Officers * * Officers are easy : Pay Grade | Army / Marines / Air Force | Navy / Coast Guard -- | -- | -- O-1 | Second Lieutenant | Ensign O-2 | First Lieutenant | Lieutenant Junior Grade O-3 | Captain | Lieutenant O-4 | Major | Lieutenant Commander O-5 | Lieutenant Colonel | Commander O-6 | Colonel | Captain O-7 | Brigadier General | Rear Admiral ( Lower Half ) O-8 | Major General | Rear Admiral ( Upper Half ) O-9 | Lieutenant General | Vice Admiral O-10 | General | Admiral There is an O-11 rank ( 5 - star ) , for General of the Army or General of the Air Force or Fleet Admiral , but those have only ever been issued for wartime commanders during WW2 , and are not in use at this time edit : fixed formatting","It 's important to start out with the point that there are 3 separate categories of military rank : Enlisted ( E1 thru E9 ) Warrant ( CWO1 thru CWO5 ) Commissioned ( O1 thru O10 ) Enlisted is the \" grunt \" category of the people sent to directly do things . Enlisted can be broken into 9 pay grades . These pay grades categorized into into 3 sub - Categories . Simple seamen , soldiers , and marines are pay grades E1 thru E3 . Starting at E4 , the ranks become Non - commisioned officers ( with some oddness with the army making some E4s \" specialists \" , which get the pay w/o the non - com status ) . These are Corporals and Sergents in the Army / Marines , and Petty Officers in the Navy . These ranks are given limited authority over a few soliders / marines / sailors in order to assist and organize them in carrying out their orders . In the context of Band of Brothers , these ranks would be in charge of leading a fireteam ( 3 - 4 soldiers ) or squad ( two fireteams ) . Starting at E7 , these ranks are considered \" Senior Non - commisioned Officers \" . They are going to be incharge of coordinating and training the non - coms under their authority and advising the officers . These are Sergents First Class , First / Master Sergents , and Sergent Majors in the army , and Chief Petty Officers ( including Senior Chief and Master Cheif ) in the Navy . I 'm going to skip CWOs because i really never had much exposure to them , and they are a special case that does n't usually fit into the typical command structure . Commissioned officers are a bit complicated because there are to types that are independent of rank : Line and Staff . Line officers are the command officers , so i 'll focus on them . Commisioned officers are the administrative and tactical leaders of their units , and junior officers ( ensigns [ navy only ] and leutenants ) generally have authority over a Platoon ( 2 or more squads ) , along with a senior NCO as an advisor . Higher ranking Officers typically have authority over larger units . The ranking nomenclature between the services is pottentially confusing at this point ( Army Captain = O3 , Navy Captian = ~~O5~~ O6 * * OR * * commanding officer of a ship ) , so I suggest simply looking up the officer 's pay - grades for that . Edit : Also , an additional , important point is the distinction between Rank and Authority . Authority trumps Rank , which means a junior enlisted that is given authority to control access to a location can safely block an O10 that is not authorized to access that location , with force if necessary .","for the enlisted ranks part of your question was how long does it take to advance in rank . E1 - e3 = right out of boot camp a guy will usually be e1or e2 They advance 1 pay grade usually every 9 - 12 month until e3 . After e3 - for each subsequent advancement they compete with their peers ..... through a combination of a board or a written test and review of the points achieved from awards and periodic evaluations . E4 = 2 - 4 years in military E5 = 3 - 9 years in the military E6 = 7 - 16 years in the military E7 = 8 - 19 years in the military E8 = 15 - 23 years in the military E9 = 18 - 25 years in the military These are all rough estimates because it really depends on the persons performance and how their peer group is manned . So for example if the guy comes in as a medic and we have lots of medics - it may take him a while to get advanced because he is competing with alot of guys for the same spots . On the other hand if he comes in and goes to nuclear power school - he is highly likely to get advanced first or second time he is eligible for every advancement because nuclear techs are in high demand and the military rewards them with quick advancement to try to keep them in the military instead of taking those skills to the civilian world where they can make more money . For officers its much harder to describe a time period .... but they get near automatic advancement from O1 to O2 and then to O3 ..... and after that they compete with their peers for advancement each year . They must be selected for advancement within a certain time period or they will be released and not allowed to stay in the military anymore ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The military ranking system in the United States is used to show how important someone is in the military.

So around the sysadmin or the talesfromtechsupport subs you may hear something like this ( this is a made up story that just includes buts and pieces of examples .

The SLA itself can include a wide variety of things depending on which services exactly are rendered . In a datacenter context uptime usually is the most important one .

","human_answers":["There is a detailed analysis [ here ] ( URL_0 ) In summary : * Safety * Roundabouts are safer than traditional stop sign or signal - controlled intersections . Roundabouts reduced injury crashes by 75 percent at intersections where stop signs or signals were previously used for traffic control , according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( IIHS ) . This includes a 90 % reduction in fatalities . * Speed * Roundabouts move traffic through an intersection more quickly , and with less congestion on approaching roads . Roundabouts promote a continuous flow of traffic since traffic is not required to stop – only yield – so the intersection can handle more traffic in the same amount of time . Studies by the IIHS of intersections in three states , including Washington , found that roundabouts contributed to an 89 percent reduction in delays and 56 percent reduction in vehicle stops . The only case where this occasionally fails is where the * * difference * * between peak flow and normal is very high . In this case traffic lights are used to assist the flow at the highest peak . In the UK this is known as a \" gyratory \" * Cost * Where long - term costs are considered , roundabouts eliminate hardware , maintenance and electrical costs associated with traffic signals a saving of between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 per year . One caveat I would make is that understanding how roundabouts work must be part of the driver learning process as it is in the UK . In those cases where roundabouts are rare and drivers not trained to use them there can be problems with drivers making unnecessary stops and not merging with the flow correctly .","Roundabouts can work well but they do depend on a few things .

In a roundabout, cars can keep moving as long as they yield to other vehicles already in the roundabout. This can help keep traffic flowing more smoothly and reduce the need for cars to stop and start, which can save time and fuel.

{"question":"What separates different types of cheese ? What 's the difference between how types of cheeses are made ? What 's done different between a hard cheese , like cheddar , and something soft like brie ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Animal the milk it taken from , the fat content of the milk ( if the cream has been separated or not ) , the kind of rennet used , the kind of bacteria cultures used , the amount of moisture squeezed out , the kind of fungal cultures used , the duration it is aged , the way it is aged ( humidity , waxed or rapped in cloth , some are aged part of the time submerged in wine or vinegar ) , and if herbs or spices are used .","It depends on what s needed for a particular kind of cheese and starts with the ingredients which are milk , cream , the enzyme rennet , and salt . Most cheeses are made from pasteurized milk and cream . Pasteurization cooks the raw milk to kill bacteria and render it sterile and fit for human consumption . It also changes the flavor but unpasteurized milk is not generally used in mass produced cheeses and is usually used in hand made batches not for sale . Safety is a stated concern . Milk and cream are placed in a large tub and an enzyme called rennet is added . Rennet used to be sourced from the stomachs of milk drinking calves of sheep , goats , and cows . It 's an enzyme that helps a young animal digest milk and it causes it to coagulate and form curds . The fat and protein in the milk cling together and separate from the more watery whey which contains lactose , whey protein , and water . The curds are mostly fat , protein , and water . The cultured milk and creme are stirred and cut several times with special blades to break up the curds and help to separate them from the whey . Eventually you end up with the curds pulled to one side and the whey is drained . You now have wet soggy curds about the consistency of soft cottage cheese . In cheddar cheese the curds are pressed and salt is mixed in which further helps dry the curds out and adds flavor . The wet curds are packed into molds that will turn them into cheese wheels . The molds are lined with cheesecloth and the curds are bundled up in the cloth and placed in the mold . Cheddaring is the act of stacking the wheel molds so that gravity forces water out of the curds and they are squeezed . Flipping the molds periodically is the cheddaring part of this process . It helps result in a dry and somewhat salty curd low in moisture . Once the desired water content is reached the molded curds are washed in a brine solution which helps keep mold from growing and also further dries out the curds . They are then left to age . The aging process is part drying out which results in a harder cheese with more intense flavors , and it 's also the breaking down of the milk proteins which form new compounds and are responsible for the darkening of the cheese and the flavor . It 's a kind of controlled spoilage . Some cheeses will be innoculated with bacteria or fungus during the curing stage in order to create an outer casing such as in brie , of velvety fungus , or the dark veins in a blue cheese . As the bacteria or fungus infests the cheese or rind , it eats some of the cheese and creates new chemicals like lactic acid which further refine and intensify it 's flavors . Cheeses like brie are kept moist during the packing and molding process and the curds are not salted as heavily . This leads to a moist and soft curd which helps promote the fungal rind to grow . Ironically the fungus forms a continuous coating and fends off other bacteria and fungus from infecting it , thereby keeping it from rotting , by the controlled application of rind fungus . The use of goats milk rather than cow , is used for some cheeses , where as cows milk is used for others . Other cheeses like mozzarella are not cured at all but instead are served fresh . They can be made without rennet as well by curdling the milk and creme with chemicals or strong acids . The soft curds are collected and squeezed in a cheese cloth to make balls . This is fresh mozzarella . If you work the balls stretching and pulling the cheese like a taffy puller , you work air into it and a grain which turns it into fresh string cheese . Swiss cheese is made much like other hard cheeses but the microorganisms added during the cheese making process produce gas bubbles which causes the holes in the cheese . Some cheeses are even infested with small insects which burrow into the rinds and this produces a mottled and hard outer coating and intense flavor and aroma . I would never eat it , but some people really love it . Smelly cheeses usually get their intense flavors and aromas from bacteria added before or after molding and pressing and are responsible for some of the body odor flavors a good cheese can produce .","There is already a pretty good answer but in addition , the growing environment for the bacteria can greatly affect the cheese . Not only does this mean the room it 's grown in but also how the cheese makers let the bacteria grow . From my understanding , there are three main ways of handling the bacterial growth on cheese : 1 . Just let it grow without much intervention 2 . Pat down the cheese to remove excess growth 3 . Clean the cheese regularly with a salt solution to encourage only new bacterial growth"],"chatgpt_answers":["There are many different types of cheese and they can be broadly grouped into categories based on their texture, flavor, and the way they are made. Hard cheeses, like cheddar, are aged for a longer period of time and tend to have a more intense flavor. They are also drier and firmer in texture. Soft cheeses, like brie, are usually aged for a shorter period of time and have a softer, creamier texture. They also tend to have a milder flavor.\\n\\nThe main difference in the way that these two types of cheese are made is in the amount of moisture that is present during the cheese-making process. Hard cheeses are made with less moisture, while soft cheeses are made with more moisture. This is because the longer aging process for hard cheeses allows for more moisture to evaporate, resulting in a drier and firmer cheese. In contrast, the shorter aging process for soft cheeses allows for less moisture to evaporate, resulting in a softer and creamier cheese.\\n\\nThere are also many other factors that can affect the flavor and texture of cheese, such as the type of milk used, the type of culture added to the milk, and the aging process. For example, some cheeses are made with goat's milk, while others are made with cow's milk. Some cheeses are aged in caves, while others are aged in specific temperature- and humidity-controlled environments.

This is viewed as being inherent in the separation of powers which is a fundamental feature of the form of government created by the US Constitution . If Congress or the Courts could force the President or his immediate advisors to disclose all of their communications , it would be practically impossible for the President to do his job .

Instead think about it in terms of the separation of powers . The courts have their area of authority , the legislature has its area of authority , and the executive branch has its area of authority .

The constitution allows an impeachment proceeding in congress but just how far could congress investigate ? If Judge A was accussed of taking the bribe could congress force Judge B to testify about his feelings on abortion , or conversations between Judges C and D regarding a specific case ?

{"question":"How does vitamin D work ? Is it a real substance that comes from the sun or is it created by our body ? I 'm pretty sure it 's just magic . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Vitamin D is a real substance . It does n't \" come from the sun \" at all , the sun just sends energy ... Your skin is full of oil and fat and stuff . One of the things it contains is cholesterol . When cholesterol is exposed to Ultraviolet light , particularly \" UV - B \" , the incoming photons knock some of the atoms in the cholesterol molecule around . The result of that knocking is Vitamin - D. Now unlike photosynthesis , which only happens in special sub - components of cells in plants , the Cholesterol- > Vitamin - D thing can happen anywhere . Like if you put a blob of it out in the sun on a dinner plate it would convert . You sort of ooze out cholesterol , and then it gets converted into \" vitamin D lotion \" , that soaks back into your skin . So there are some surprising things here to \" Get Vitamin - D from the sun \" : - Depending on where you live , you may only be able to make significant quantities around noon ( or 1 pm on Daylight savings time ) because that 's the only time of the day that enough UV - B can get through the sky . The further towards the poles you get the smaller the window . - If you shower or bathe too soon before you sunbathe ( like six hours ) you can wash away most of the Cholesterol and there is nothing to convert . - If you shower or bathe too soon after you sunbathe ( like eight hours ) you can wash away the \" Vitamin - D lotion \" before it really soaks back into your skin . - It is very easy to get sunburnt without really getting any Vitamin - D in your system at all .

The question is only whether when they leave office should be decided by the voters ---via the elections --- or decided in advance by whoever imposes / approved the term limit .

GIFs are literally just a whole lot of pictures that flash up sequentially , but if you look at each one individually you 'll notice that large parts of each picture do n't actually change from picture to picture ( i.e. the background might be the same throughout ) . So a compressed video file recognises this and tells your video player that those parts do n't need to change and so the amount of \" new \" information from frame to frame is n't anywhere near as much as in a GIF which treats every frame as entirely new information . Another way to look at it is through animation . If you make a crude animation on a flip book you have to draw everything on each single page and so there is a lot of information in your flip book . However hand drawn animation will use static backgrounds and you only need to redraw what is actually moving in the scene on each page ( in this case your pages would need to be translucent so the background remains visible ) .

{"question":"How do internet speed tests work ? When using an internet speed test , am I just downloading as much data from their servers as possible ? Will this use a lot of data on my mobile plan ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Sort of . In short , speed tests are conducted by simply retrieving a file from a server for calculating download speeds and then sending files back to the server for calculating upload speeds . Usually this is done in a short period of time ( such as 2 - 10s ) , and big files are not necessarily needed to make this measurement . Modern speed tests are actually able to change dynamically the amount of data downloaded based on the initial results , so a faster internet would download more data so it can accurately calculate your speed . Think of it like this : let 's suppose you have a 4 megabits per second download speed on your phone . When you touch \" start test \" , your phone will try to download a 1 megabyte file . Since it 1 megabyte is equal to 8 megabits , it should take 2 seconds to download the file . Now if you were to have a 400 megabits per second connection , downloading a 1 megabyte file would take only 0.02 seconds ... this is not enough time to make an average , so a bigger file would be needed in this case to accurately measure your speed .

{"question":"Why do countries with nuclear weapons have significantly more nukes than there are cities that they 'd ever even consider nuking ? For example , the US has over 4,000 , and at one point had over 30,000 . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Because once a nuclear war starts your first move is to go for the other guys nukes . So , if you have three times as many as you need , then you can afford to have 2/3rds of your subs , silos , and bombers destroyed . In the same respect , nuclear missile defense also lowered the effectiveness of nuclear weapons , causing people to solve he problem by just overwhelming the system with more and more warheads .","There are a lot of reasons for this . One is that it 's not just cities that were target . Missile bases , airfields , bridges , power plants , bunkers , SAM sites ... there are lots of potential targets , depending on your targeting philosophy . The other is about reliability and accuracy . The US Titan II missile had a 9 megaton warhead , and had a circular error probable ( CEP ) of 900 m. That means it had a 50 % chance of landing within 900 m ( 1 X CEP ) of its target , 43 % chance of landing within 1800 m ( 2 X CEP ) , and 7 % chance of landing with 2100 m ( 3 X CEP ) . Let 's imagine , just for kicks , that this weapon would work correctly 100 % of the time . If you needed 200 psi of blast pressure to destroy a point - sized target ( e.g. , something very small relative to 9 megatons ) , the chance that any given Titan II you launch will put that much blast pressure on the target is about 73 % ( this is the \" single shot kill probability \" or SSKP ) . That 's not too bad , but what if the target is _ important _ . How many nukes , then , do you need to launch to get that up to basically 100 % ? The math works out to two Titan IIs . OK , what if the blast pressure we need is 1000 psi , for , say , a hardened , underground silo ? Your SSKP drops to 54 % . That 's a lot lower , but you still only need 2 missiles to get your total probability of kill up to about 100 % . These numbers can change a lot for weapons with different yields ( high yield makes it harder to miss ) , different accuracy ( higher accuracy means you can use lower yields ) , different assumptions about reliability ( in the above calculations , we assumed that 100 % of the Titan IIs we fire will actually behave as expected — if we drop that number to , say , 90 % , then the probabilities of kill go down ) , and different assumptions about the target ( it gets more complicated if you need to put that amount of pressure down on a larger area , esp . for high pressures and low yields ) . The result is that it 's very easy to have targets that need 4 or 5 nukes per target to guarantee total destruction . ( If your requirements for total destruction are lower — e.g. 80 % probability — then the number of nukes decreases . ) Which is just to say — the assumption of \" one nuke , one target \" is wrong . Typically the assumption is that for some targets , many nukes would be aimed at it , with the assumption that not all of them would destroy it adequately . Combine this with the proliferation of targets in the Cold War plans , and the fact that the services were often not totally coordinated on their plans ( bombers , ICBMs , and SLBMs could be redundantly aimed at the same targets ) , and you end up with absurdities like hundreds of nukes aimed at Moscow alone as late as 1991 . Lastly , when the US had over 30,000 nuclear weapons , a huge percentage of those were tactical nuclear weapons , meant to be used against tanks and troops and bombers in the battlefield , not on \" strategic \" targets like cities or bases or whatever . So those have their own targeting considerations . [ Here 's a quick graph I made ] ( URL_0 ) showing US and Soviet strategic vs. tactical nuke warheads — the US certainly had a crap ton of strategic weapons ( over 10,000 from 1964 until 1991 ) , but those huge points of the stockpile were because of the bonkers - levels of tactical weapons ( +20,000 ) that they had . Ditto the Soviets .","You do n't just nuke cities though ! You will target major military bases , command centers , key bits of infrastructure like pipelines , dams , or bridges . And not all nukes have the same yield or various settings . So you have giant city killing ones , and smaller ones meant to be used in a tactical setting , or against important targets like ships or airfields . And often you will target each location with multiple warheads to ensure the damage gets done . And since you ca nt predict when you will be called upon to launch you want to have enough that even if you ca n't launch many in time , or suffer catastrophic losses before they get off the ground or in the air , you will still have enough left to do the job ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Countries with nuclear weapons have significantly more nuclear weapons than they would need to destroy cities because they want to have a strong deterrent against other countries with nuclear weapons.

The aircraft are not certified to operate outside of their charted performance limits . That is not to say they will just blow up and not get off the ground , but rather the cost - benefit for an airliner to fly a jet full of people in * * uncertified conditions * * is not worth it . ELI20 below : When aircraft go through certification the engineers go through an expensive process of drawing up performance charts based on typical weather conditions , fuel states and other factors . The actual flight testing , modeling , and administrative process ( paperwork , signatures , FAA signoff , etc . ) is EXTREMELY expensive and so what aircraft manufacturers will typically do is just produce a minimum number of charts for a common range of conditions ( for example , say 10 charts depicting takeoff performance ranging from -40degs up to 20deg celsius . So on a day with 10deg C you would look up takeoff performance , cruise , landing performance , etc . all the relevant 10deg charts and figure out how much fuel you can take , how many passengers can be loaded , how long of a runway you need to takeoff , etc ... ) .

This has a negative impact on the amount of lift that can be generated , which can prevent some planes from taking off safely ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure! So, planes need to generate a lot of lift in order to be able to fly. Lift is what helps them rise into the air and stay up there. One of the main things that helps a plane generate lift is its wings. The shape of the wings is designed to produce lift as the plane moves through the air.\\n\\nNow, the air around us is made up of tiny molecules that are constantly moving and bouncing around. The faster these molecules are moving, the more heat there is. So, when the temperature is really high, the molecules in the air are moving really fast, and that can make it harder for a plane to generate enough lift to get off the ground.\\n\\nIt's kind of like trying to jump really high on a trampoline when it's really hot outside. The trampoline is bouncier because the heat has made the springs expand, so it's harder to get as much lift as you normally would. Planes work in a similar way, except they use their wings instead of springs to generate lift.\\n\\nSo, if it's too hot outside, the air might not be bouncy enough to give the plane the lift it needs to get off the ground. That's why some planes can't fly when it's really hot outside."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Great question! Planes need to take off and stay in the air using their engines, which burn fuel in order to generate thrust. When the temperature gets really high outside, it can affect the performance of the engines by making the air thinner, which means that there is less oxygen available for them to burn fuel properly. This can make it difficult or even impossible for the plane to generate enough thrust to take off or stay in the air. Additionally, operating the engines at high temperatures can cause internal problems"}

The DNA in our cells is packed into something known as [ chromosomes ] ( URL_2 ) . Humans , for example , have 23 * pairs * of chromosomes , 23 from our mom , 23 from our dad , the 23 pair up and give birth to us .

But , to compare between species and individuals , we change the \" 23 \" for a \" n \" , so , humans have * * 2n * * sets of chromosomes . All the cells in your body are 2n ( they have two sets of the 23 chromosomes ) .

The only variables are \" time stored \" and \" access speed ( speed that the CPU gets the information ) \" . There are also SSD , that work the same way as Hard - Drives but are way faster ( and expensive as well ) . The major differences are that you can access RAM several times faster ( from 50 to 600 ) but the information on the RAM is lost when you turn the power off . So RAM is good to hold information you are working ( like videos that are playing , programs in execution , etc ) and Hard - Drives are good to store information for long times ( albums you \" downloaded \" , images , etc ) Think of that like : Hard - Drives are for storing information \" for ever \" .

There are a few reasons why the price per GB of different types of memory can vary so much.\\n\\nFirst, it's important to understand that different types of memory are designed to do different things.

A hard drive, on the other hand, is used to store files and data on your computer, but it doesn't need to access that data as quickly as a graphics card does.\\n\\nBecause of this difference in how they're used, graphics cards and hard drives are made with different types of memory. Graphics cards typically use a type of memory called VRAM (Video Random Access Memory) that is specifically designed to be able to access and store large amounts of data very quickly. Hard drives, on the other hand, use a type of memory called magnetic storage that is not as fast as VRAM, but is much cheaper to produce.\\n\\nAnother reason for the price difference is that graphics cards and hard drives are made in different quantities. Because graphics cards are used in a smaller number of devices (like computers and gaming consoles) compared to hard drives (which are used in almost all computers), the companies that make graphics cards can charge more for them.\\n\\nFinally, the price of memory can also be affected by supply and demand. If there is a high demand for a particular type of memory and a limited supply of it, the price will go up.

If you thought it meant lunch box , then we 'd be really confused both of us , and ultimately we probably could n't understand each other at all . Mathematics is the same . To be able to communicate calculation of adding two to three , and multiplying that result with 5 , you could write it out like that . However , because we have mathematical symbols , you could just write that as ( 2 + 3 ) * 5 , which is much easier once you understand the language of these symbols . You could , if you wanted to , leave it at that , always using parenthesis to indicate which order to do operations in . But actually , it turns out you can save the effort of writing bunch of parenthesis if everyone agrees on some order of operations in which one should calculate these operations in . The default way . You would still sometimes need parenthesis , sure , but for some cases the order of operations would be the same as the order you wanted to calculate the numbers in . Like , 2 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 could be written as 2 + ( 2 * ( 3 ^ 2 ) ) if you did n't have order of operations(other than that parenthesis first ) .

And because these expressions were such central focus , it makes much sense to make our order of operations such that you never need a single parenthesis to write out a polynomials . If you really wanted to , you could use parenthesis for that too , to indicate order of operations : ( x^3 ) + ( 2 * ( x^2 ) ) + ( 17x ) - 11 . I 'm just trying to demonstrate how much pointless extra effort you 'd have to use when dealing with these kinds of expressions if you did n't have PEMDAS specifically . tl;dr : Math is a language , and languages have rules . This rule is because of polynomials .","There 's a specific order so that everyone gets the same answers when they evaluate the same expression . ( Barring people purposefully writing ambiguous statements on Facebook ) The reason the operations are done in that particular order is because that 's the order you go in when you 're evaluating a polynomial . Setting it as the default order means that you do n't need to use any parentheses when writing polynomials . For instance , we can write 3 * x^(2 ) + 8 * x + 4 without using any parentheses at all . If multiplication and division took precedence over exponents and roots , we 'd need to write that expression as 3 * ( x^(2 ) ) + 8 * x + 4 . If addition and subtraction took precedence over multiplication and division , we 'd need to write it as ( 3 * x^(2 ) ) + ( 8 * x ) + 4 . And if the operations were done in completely opposite order ( parentheses indicate that an operation needs to be done out of order , so in any order of operations , parentheses automatically have top precedence ) , we would need to write the expression as ( 3 * ( x^(2 ) ) ) + ( 8 * x ) + 4 . Thus , the order we 've settled on is PEMDAS because that 's the order you have to go in when evaluating polynomials . ( Insert obligatory \" PEMDAS is misleading because it implies multiplication and addition take precedence over their respective inverses \" rant )","First , to be clear , the order of operations is more accurately PE(M|D)(A|S ) . Subtraction is just a different kind of addition , and division is the same thing as multiplying by the inverse . So you do P , then E , and the M or D from left to right , then A or S from left to right . This is a convention , it does n't have to be this way . It was devised due to historic reasons and convenience . With it , equations can be terse and concise . Without it , we would have to surround everything in parenthesis to explicitly define the sequence , and that would make equations verbose and difficult to understand ."],"chatgpt_answers":["PEMDAS is a mnemonic that stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.

{"question":"How do our bodies \" read \" DNA ? I know that DNA is the order of chemicals telling the body / cells what to do , but how do the cells know what the DNA means ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Well , the cells do n't exactly \" know \" what the DNA means , per se . The process of converting genes ( DNA ) into their functional output , typically proteins , begins with a process called transcription . During this process , an enzyme ( a type of protein ) scans the DNA and makes a copy of a gene . But , instead of copying it in the form of DNA , it makes a copy of it in the form of RNA . A good analogy to this would be if your mother emailed you a recipe and you did n't have a printer handy , so you wrote instead , you write it down . The message still says the same thing , but it is in printed handwriting instead of electronic data . The next step in the process is converting that RNA information into something that is functional , a protein . This happens in a cell structure called the ribosome . The newly created RNA enters the ribosome , and through a process called translation . Essentially , the ribosome \" decodes \" the RNA and translates it into the language or proteins . A cells in every living organism convert the RNA information into proteins using the same genetic code by reading it in three letter ( A , C , G , T ) chunks called codons . The codons tell the ribosome how to build the protein and when to stop adding pieces . These pieces are called amino acids . Going back to the analogy , this is like you reading the recipe , combining the ingredients , and cooking it in the correct way . Protein translation is essentially the same thing , turning 1 - dimensional information into a 3 - dimensional product . Now , if you are asking how the cell knows which genes to activate or not to activate , that is another discussion . I would be more than willing to discuss that as well if you are interested .","At the most basic level , DNA is a code that contains genes , which are instructions for making proteins . Proteins are the main functional molecules in cells . DNA is transcribed into mRNA , which is then translated into a chain of amino acids that fold up to form a protein . Three - base sequences of DNA / RNA called ' codons ' code for different amino acids . DNA contains more information than just the recipes for different proteins , however . There are regulatory regions of DNA that help control when different genes are being made into proteins .","All of the responses so far are very lengthy so if you want a tldr : some of the molecules in your body are able to attach to your dna and change shape slightly depending on which part of a dna they attach to .

If you google ' human sleep cycle ' , you will see for the first 4 hours or so of the sleep cycle dedicated to some rem , the normal alpha and beta , and the delta deep sleep . After that is a long period of cyclic rem sleep until you launch out of it . No delta sleep is ' normal ' , after the delta sleep cycle , is a period of recouping a lot of REM sleep . This is because obviously as mammals for quite sometime we were nt necessarily safe sleeping 8 whole hours in a deep enough sleep to heal up and rest up our gigantic brains . The extra rem at the end is just your brain recouping since you are nt having another 4 hr sleep cycle with REM and delta wave deep sleep .

The brain is efficient at logical tasks , social tasks , but the body and its stress from physical expendeture is an entirely different thermodynamic expendeture , and homo sapian biology , when it comes to rest , is very dependent on the body 's hormonal cycling after physical work to garner enough chemicals to turn your brain off .

The bottles _ are _ chosen for being hard to glue shut using the glue that it contains .

So one of the main difference between glues that some are \" filling glues \" and some are \" contact cements \" . A white glue is a filling glue . It works by filling the tiny gaps and pores in each of the surfaces and then \" sticking to itself \" . White glue basically forms a puzzle piece that is locked into the irregularities the two or more parts being glued . This is why you can let it dry on your hand and peel it off to find a mold of your hand print . If you let that harden fully it becomes quite strong . Basically the body of the glue is \" structural \" . Various \" super glues \" are exactly the opposite . They ca n't stick to themselves well . If you let a drop of it try out the result is brittle and easily broken or shattered . So you want to use as little as possible when you use superglue . If you let a layer build up the joint will not hold . But it works well on \" smooth and hard surfaces \" . So it 's good for things like sticking glass to metal . It still relies somewhat on microscopic irregularities , but the more perfect the match between the surfaces the better the glue works because it 's stronger for being in close contact with both sides of the joint . So glue is fascinating stuff , and picking the right glue is a skill , but lots of glues will work \" well enough \" where \" the right glue \" could have been superb .","It either needs water to evaporate from it or air to become solid .

What has Loud done to me ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["The Loudness War is defined as a trend in recorded music that has gotten generally louder and louder over time . Early records were relatively quiet ; later records would record at louder volumes ; compact discs set a digital limit that sound engineers would come up against through different compression techniques , and so on . As time goes on , it seems the louder music wins out as being the more popular music of the day . Many consumers do n't seem to care as much for sound quality as they do for the loudness of the music , as that can grab their attention . As for what side you 're on ? Well , that 's a personal question . Do you prefer more dynamic sound with good quality , or is it all Top 40 hits at max volume for you ?","Music sounds better at high volumes . Partially because you can hear more intricacies and you 're more immersed , and partially just because that 's how our brains work . Therefore , over the past few decades , producers have been mastering songs louder and louder , constantly running up against the physical limits of their media ( vinyl , cassettes , CDs , digital media ) . This is so that their songs sound better on the radio without needing the listener to turn up the volume . But there 's a catch . Mastering a song against the upper limits of its format sacrifices dynamic range and intricacies . There ca n't be loud parts if the entire song is at max . And frequencies near the limits of our hearing need to be louder to be heard through more accessible frequencies , but those are lost too . On the radio , these sacrifices do n't matter . It 's the radio , it 's going to sound bad no matter what , so maxing out loudness makes your song more noticeable to the average listener . But when it comes to listening on a system that does n't sound like crap ( literally anything better than radio ) , the song will sound better if it 's mastered quieter and with more dynamic range . Turning up the volume on your listening device does not necessarily have the same catches . It depends on the limits of your setup . It makes more sense to leave all the intricacies in the track and let the listener adjust the volume . Example : URL_0","You are n't quite on a side .

However, in the Loudness War, music is often made as loud as possible by using techniques like compression and limiting, which reduce the dynamic range and make all parts of the song sound equally loud.\\n\\nThis can make music sound more \"powerful\" and \"impactful,\" but it can also make it sound less dynamic and less enjoyable to listen to, especially if the music is played at low volumes or on low-quality speakers.\\n\\nSo, whether you are for or against the Loudness War really depends on your personal preference.

For example, a country may prefer to admit immigrants who have specific skills that are in demand in the local labor market, or who are able to invest in the country's economy.\\n\\nFinally, political considerations can also play a role in a country's decision to admit refugees.

{"question":"Why must there always be economic growth ? When reading news articles or watching TV , we hear that economic shrinking is bad , stagnation is disconcerting , and growth is good . Is a constantly growing economy even feasible ? What 's wrong with stagnation or shrinking ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["1 ) Population is always growing , barring some horrible catastrophe or war . Therefore , economic output must also increase in order to create the jobs , and goods , all those new people need . This is true just about everywhere . 2 ) The value of money is almost always inflating , so people need corresponding wage increases in order to continue to afford to live . As wages stagnate and prices continue to grow , eventually people ca n't afford to pay for everything they need , such as rent / mortgages , food , gas , cloths , etc . Constant economic growth makes businesses more money , which results in them paying their employees more . ( In before some socialist comes and rants at me about growing wage gaps or whatever . This is an economic principle , and yelling at me wo n't change that ) 3 ) If the economy is n't growing , then it 's shrinking . This translates to businesses shutting down , people losing their jobs , and less tax revenue for the government . Each of these things results in , in order ; fewer goods for sale , resulting in higher prices ; fewer people with money to spend , resulting in even more businesses closing ; and the reduction of government programs , which means more people without jobs . Combine these problems with either of the previous examples and you have a recipe for massive unemployment , exorbitant prices , and a bankrupt government that continues to spiral downwards until the country collapses . TL;DR , An economy that is n't growing is like a body that ca n't make new cells . You 'll be dead in a week .","Because there is population growth , and because people expect their standard of living to improve over time . An economy has only so much wealth in it , and that wealth is distributed amongst everyone in it . If you have new people , you need more stuff , or everyone has to do with less . In addition , we are always coming up with new ways to make life better . Those things are n't free . If everyone wants a car and air conditioning and internet and smartphones and MRI machines , we need economic growth to pay for those things .","These people are literally all wrong . The real answer depends what level you 're referring to . If you 're talking a global scale , it 's because of the increase in technology and the decrease of inefficiency in the market . Tech increase means any advancement that increases real output , such as a better way to farm or a way to make better houses . Decrease in market inefficiency are things such as removing minimum wages , tariffs , etc . Note , these things may lead to a worse economy in one country , but the global economy as a whole will constantly grow . People saying bullshit about capitalism and unsustainable growth are completely misinterpreting Marx . If you 're referring to an individual country level , then growth occurs due to the things mentioned above , but also at the expense of other countries . This much is self explanatory . The reason the economy shrinking is bad is because technology is always increasing such that real output of the entire global system is always increasing . If one country is sitting there and staying flat or shrinking , that means it is losing relative economic strength compared to other countries . This tends to have a compounding effect as the country is forced to do things that cause the economy to become even weaker . An example is minimum wage . If the US was n't hemorrhaging high skilled labor ( such as techs at a chip fabrication plant ) then the US may not need to have to increase its minimum wage to bring the lowest standard deviation of the population to livable wages . But alas the US is shitting jobs like mad and Walmart workers get paid scraps so the US has to introduce heavy inefficiency to the system by raising the minimum wage . Edit : Please note I 'm being 100 % serious about everyone else saying a load of bullshit . Money does n't inflate for fun . It can deflate just as easily if you feel like making it that way , a la bitcoin . Saying money magically decreases in value just for the sake of it is not real economics .

{"question":"What keeps the actions of the President of the USA in check ? If there are no limitations on powers , would that not result in a dictatorship ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["This is a pretty good question , considering . I 'll give it my best . The president , as head of the executive branch , is given broad authority to execute the laws passed by congress . Congress ca n't be expected to pass a law , for example , to quickly prevent travel to a country based on an outbreak of a disease . Thus , a law is passed that gives the president authority to restrict travel , within some confines . These confines , as outlined in each individual law are what limit the president . There are also constitutional limits and powers granted to each branch of the government . In the event that one branch over reaches into another 's , the courts can rule and end the disagreement . This does require , for example a given police branch to respect the court order and not do as the President said . Let 's look at a deportation example where an Executive Order has an impact , within the law . The laws are fairly clear , but Congress ca n't dictate individually the priority of each class of immigrant , and how deportation should be focused . This would require constant revision of the law . So , under Obama , for example , the president issued an Executive order instructing Immigrations and Costume Enforcement to focus on violent ( illegally migrated ) criminals and leave children alone . This is not law , and to not violate law if all violent illegally migrated criminals had been dealt with , Obama would have had a constitutional obligation to continue following the law laid out by congress and turn the focus of I.C.E. to the remaining immigrants . In short , the President can only act within the guidelines laid out by law . Sometimes these are broad , and other times they are narrow . If the President oversteps the law ( or does not fulfill it ) either Congress can impeach or ( more likely ) the courts rule his actions illegal .","A President can only act to enforce existing law . Congress can rewrite the laws . If a President 's actions are believed to be contradictory to the law or unconstitutional , they can be challenged in the courts . The Supreme Court has the ability to strike down an Executive Order . Those two checks limit the specific actions of the President . There is also impeachment . The House of Representatives can vote to impeach the President for treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors . If his actions are seriously illegal , they will vote to impeach him on specific charges , and then the Senate will try him on the charges . If two - thirds of the Senate votes for a conviction , the President would be removed from office .","Presidential power is limited by the other two branches of the US federal government and their checks and balances , which were placed in the US Constitution . The US federal government is divided into three branches : 1 ) The president - aka the executive branch , which enforces the law 2 ) Congress - aka the legislative branch , which creates the law 3 ) The Supreme Court - aka the judicial branch , which interprets the law Each branch is designed to be ' checked and balanced ' by the other branches . For example , Congress can pass laws , but the president can choose not to sign them into law ( veto ) . Similarly , the president actually appoints all Supreme Court justices , but Congress also must approve those appointees ( the appointment is a position for life ) . Congress also approves a president 's cabinet members . Dictatorship is , in theory , prevented by any of the following : 1 ) the president can be impeached by Congress . 2 ) a citizen or entity can argue the president ( or Congress , even ) have taken illegal action through the US court system and these cases often reach the Supreme Court . 3 ) Term limits . Presidents can serve no more than 2 terms . 4 ) The electorate demographics . Voting districts change through time . The system was very simplistic when first designed , but the founding fathers did not for see the problems that a two - party political system would create ( nor did they plan for the nation to have only two parties - most have at least 3 ) . In the US there are really only two political parties : the left / liberals / Democrats and the right / conservatives / Republicans . Issues arise when the same political party is largely running all three branches of the government . This is particularly influential in the Judicial branch because supreme court justices are appointed for life . While Congress and the presidency can change political leanings in the span of a year to four , the court can stay leaning left or right for a very long time . At times the court has been strongly liberal and at other times strongly conservative . The leanings of the court really all just comes down to the lifetimes of the justices on the court and who happens to be running the presidency and congress when they die , requiring a new spot to be filled . Right now , you are likely hearing about Trump 's announcement tonight because there is a vacancy on the supreme court , which does n't happen often and affords a president potentially extreme power in how laws are interpreted . We usually have 9 justices , but a justice passed away last year and we only have 8 . And so here 's an example of the checks and balances : Obama would have normally been the president to make the make an appointment as the justice died while he was in office . However , Congress was majority republican and so refused to approve any of his appointees because they would have been liberal - leaning . Congress held off in the hope that the incoming president would be of their party and thus appoint a conservative - leaning justice . Trump , the president , is Republican , but was elected by a narrow margin , meaning half the country are n't aligned with his politcal views . The Senate and House are both majority Republican and have enough numbers to make them capable of passing laws without involving the democrats ( which is unusual , but not unheard of in the history of the nation ) . And , this evening , it 's likely Trump 's justice appointee will be strongly conservative . Given the current demographics of the other court justices , this would also make the supreme court conservative leaning . So , all three branches would them become strongly conservative , including the court , which could remain that way for a very long time . This creates a situation where long standing controversial court rulings , such as Roe vs. Wade which legalized abortion , could be over - turned ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The President of the United States has a lot of power, but there are also a lot of checks and balances in place to make sure that one person cannot have too much power.\\n\\nOne way that the President's power is limited is by the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the United States.

That way you would not break an oath if the President went crazy . But you better be damn sure he went crazy before you disobeyed . Source : was a military officer and studied Constitutional law . EDIT : It 's been a while since I reenlisted a service member but I should have remembered that there is a part about supporting and defending the Constitution in the enlisted oath . Rather the part about obeying orders is OMITTED from the officer 's oath . Obviously everyone should support and defend the Constitution . The basic premise above , however , is the same . The omission defaults an officer 's charge to think critically about the larger picture . Thanks to those in the comments that reminded me . EDIT the second : In my opinion , no , there is no provision to overthrow the government or President based on an order that may be unlawful , unethical , or immoral . You would be committing treason at that point . There is a proper way to dissent -- through inaction if it does n't pass the legal , ethical , and moral test . EDIT the third : Thanks for the gold ! EDIT the fourth : KesselZero 's comment below is a more succinct answer to the actual question at hand . Basically , our Constitutional system of government has several redundant mechanisms to prevent a rouge ( rogue ) President . EDIT the fifth : I 'm keeping my typo , dammit .","A lot of the Constitution is set up to protect the peaceful transfer of power . Basically , the only way the government should ever change hands is through different candidates winning elections . So while the armed forces swear to the Constitution , not the president , the Constitution itself includes a couple of methods ( impeachment and the 25th amendment ) by which a bad , crazy , sick etc . president can be removed and replaced . Ideally this would remove the need for the army to overthrow the president , because the other parts of our government ( legislature and judiciary ) could handle it . The problem with the armed forces doing it is that a. ) it 's not a peaceful transfer of power , and b. ) the armed forces are now in charge of the government , which is bad . Having the military swear to the Constitution also serves another purpose , which is to separate them from the president , even though he 's the commander in chief . One important move that Hitler made when he came to power was to have the military stop pledging to serve Germany and start pledging to him personally . His hope was that their loyalty to him would lead them to follow his orders even if they were harmful to the nation or its citizens . This fear goes back at least as far as ancient Rome , when ( for example ) Julius Caesar was able to become ~~emperor~~ dictator because he had a large army of soldiers who were loyal to him personally , rather than to the Roman Republic . * Edit :* Thank you for the gold ! And thanks to those who are correcting and refining my history . This was all off the top of my head so there were bound to be mistakes .","In theory , military commanders are supposed to disobey an order that is unconstitutional : no need for a coup . In theory . Of course , if said commanders back the President anyway , that wo n't make any difference -- and it 's not as if there 's anyone else in a position to stop the military . This is the problem with a standing army , one which the US , in its early history , actively tried to avoid ( hence the Second Amendment , which speaks of the need for a \" well - regulated militia \" ) . You should probably cross your fingers and hope we never have to find out . Suppose the President suddenly announces that all presidential elections are cancelled , and that he is President for life . A blatantly illegal and unconstitutional act . What could happen ? Well , if things work correctly , either Congress or the Supreme Court , or both , will put a stop to that . For example , Congress could impeach the President -- effectively putting him on trial , and if found guilty , removing him from office . But what if things go really , horribly wrong . Perhaps Congress refuses to impeach . Maybe the President and those around him have been using personal and direct threats against Congressmen and their families ( Hitler did something similar to ensure his rise to the top ) . For whatever reason , that mechanism has broken down , and those few brave souls who dare speak out are silenced , perhaps arrested or simply dismissed . Can the military stage a coup ? To be honest , if things have got to that stage , then the rule of law has irretrievably broken down anyhow : doing nothing at all would simply allow the totalitarian dictatorship to establish itself . And I would imagine an awful lot of civil unrest , as civilians opposed to the President protest and are met with those sympathetic to him , and that might be serious enough for the military to impose martial law , simply to restore some kind of order . But here we 're talking about a military coup , and military coups are not often good news . If you 're lucky , a military coup might succeed in removing the dictatorship , and returning the country to civilian rule as quickly and painlessly as possible . If you 're unlucky , a military coup simply replaces a civilian dictatorship with a military dictatorship .

Instead , you move heat from inside the freezer to outside the freezer . A compressor is used to compress a fluid on its way from pipes inside the freezer to pipes outside . When you compress the fluid , you have the same amount of heat in a smaller volume , which means a higher temperature . Those pipes pass by a fan on the outside of the freezer that cools the pipes back off to room temperature , blowing excess heat into the room . The fluid is then allowed to decompress on the way back into the freezer , which makes it drop in temperature ( the same amount of heat spread out across a larger volume ) . It can then absorb heat from inside the freezer , and the process repeats .","Thermodynamics . Okay so a five yr old wo n't understand what that is . But it is removing heat from a cold space . The concept of it is a little bit complex but will do my best to explain . There 's kind of like two parts to any liquid / gas - the pressure and the temperature . If you mess with one you will change the other . Fridges use a compressor to quickly raise the temperature of the liquid , and ejects it to the outside of the fridge . Then the liquid is pushed through a nozzle that expands the liquid / gas ( an evaporator ) and this raises the pressure and lowers temp . I 'm an engineer but even as I type this I do n't think I 've got it completely accurate - I barely passed thermo .","What you do is you have an enclosed loop filled with a gas . Any gas could potentially work , but there is a class of gases called ' refrigerants ' which are generally always used . So in this loop you have 4 components , each performing a specific task . Let 's start at the compressor . - The compressor takes in cool gas and compresses it to high pressure . This causes the gas to get quite hot . - The hot gas then flows through a heat exchanger . This might just be a section of long thin tubes over which air flows . This room temperature air flows over the tubes and out of an exhaust . Heat travels from the hot gas , through the walls of the small pipes and into the exhaust air . This happens because heat energy always travels from hot to cold . Now the hot gases inside the tubes have been cooled considerably and have now become liquid and the heat blown outside . - The now cool liquid flows through a pressure reducing valve . This allows the liquid to expand back to lower pressure and becomes a liquid - vapour mixture . When this happens , the temperature drops to very cold temperatures ( remember how compressing gas heats it up ? Well expanding gas cools it . You may have noticed this if you have ever used cylinders with compressed gas , such as air for breathing apparatus ) . - The very cold gas / liquid now flows through another heat exchanger . This time air comes from outside , is cooled by the cold gas in the system , and blown to wherever to cooling is required . This causes the cold gas to warm up ( as it is absorbing heat from outside air ) , so all the liquid evaporates and we are now back to the start , ready for compression . So in summary - Refrigerant ( gas ) is compressed and heats up . - The hot compressed refrigerant is cooled using outside air which is blown away , usually out of an exhaust . - The cool liquid refrigerant expands through a special valve , causing it to cool . - The cold refrigerant ( gas+liquid ) cools outside air which is used for cooling , thus the refrigerant warms up . - Cycle repeats . Bonus info : Cooling the compressed gas could use water or air depending on the design of the system . The heat exchanger which cools the compressed refrigerant is called a condenser because it condenses gas to liquid .

{"question":"What do scientists mean by saying we might be living in a holographic universe ? I saw this article in reddit , URL_0 What does that mean ? Thanks ! Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["A few things led up to this . First , it 's been considered that one way to resolve the issue of information loss in black holes is that the information is n't encoded in the volume of the hole , but the area . That is to say , small fluctuations in the event horizon- the surface- of the black hole carry all of the information for the entire hole . The rationale for this is somewhat involved , and hard to explain \" ELI5 \" , but ... a black hole is as much information as you can cram into a given space . That concept \" as much information as you can cram into a particular space \" has a name , \" Bekenstein bound \" . That bound is defined by the * square * of the radius of any region , not the * cube * ... that means the area , and not the volume of a region defines it 's total entropic capacity . So ... if that 's the case it 's argued by some , since that 's true of any region ( not just black holes ) , maybe the universe itself is composed of information encoded on a 2D boundary , not within a 3D volume . In essence , we 'd be like a soap bubble , rather than a softball . It does n't * really * matter to you and I and our daily lives though ; it does n't imply some kind of unreality or ephemeral nature to things .

TLDR : The universe is one big flat credit card hologram sticker .","I think this one is a case of over - interpretation of scientific language by laypeople . Colloquially we use the term \" hologram \" to refer to some form of 3d image or illusion without substance such as the ones on credit cards or 3d displays .

To a physicist it just means : some physical property inside this volume can be determined / reproduced by what happens on its surface . Somewhat similar to how I can determine the trajectory of a thrown object by only knowing its velocity and position at a single point in time . That does n't imply that the remainder of the trajectory is \" just a simulation \" or \" not real \" . The connection between these two terms is of course that you can use the physicists idea of hologram to produce a hologram in the 3d picture sense . This is due to wave phenomena such as light but also sound having exactly this property . If you can capture the wave field on some 2d surface surrounding a volume you can reconstruct what the wave field inside the volume looks like . Classic holograms work exactly like this . You bounce a laser off an object and bring it to interference with a reference laser beam and record the resulting interference pattern on a photographic plate .

If you then shine only the reference beam back at the recorded pattern it reproduces the original wave field which our eyes interpret as an image of the object ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The idea that the universe might be a hologram refers to the concept that the universe is a projection or imitation of something else, rather than a truly independent and self-contained entity.

With streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, people can watch movies and TV shows at home on their own TVs or devices. This means that some people might not feel the need to go to a movie theater as often.\\n\\nAnother reason is that movie theaters can be expensive. Between the cost of tickets, concessions, and transportation, it can add up quickly. Some people might feel like they can get a similar experience at home for a lower cost.\\n\\nFinally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on movie theaters. Many theaters had to close or limit the number of people who could attend because of health and safety concerns. This meant that fewer people were able to go to the movies, which made it harder for theaters to make money.\\n\\nOverall, movie theaters are facing a combination of cultural and economic challenges.

{"question":"How does a gravity boost work ? I have heard that many missions which take satellites beyond earth have used a gravity boost from Jupiter to speed up . But how would that work ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["When you get a gravity assist , you leave the planet / moon you 're getting the gravity assist from at the same speed you approached it , but not in the same direction(your trajectory would be hyperbolic or parabolic ) . Think of Jupiter like a truck moving down the highway , flying your spacecraft behind it as it orbits around the sun is like bouncing a ball off the front of the truck as it approaches , flying your spacecraft in front of Jupiter is like bouncing your ball off the back of the truck as its moving away from you . Basically , if you leave Jupiter going more in the direction Jupiter is moving than when you approached it , it will transfer some of it 's energy to you . If you leave Jupiter going in the opposite direction jupiter is moving , it will take some energy away from you . Edit : Here are a couple of examples from KSP . The first is an example of a gravity assist that sends the ship out into solar orbit , the second is an example of a free return trajectory , where the gravity assist sends you back home . URL_0","The speed you gain from the gravity of the planet as you approach is basically zero sum , that is , you will lose that extra speed when you try to escape the gravity of the planet , but what you do get to keep is the speed from the planet orbiting the sun ... Try to imagine a planet orbiting the sun like a handle on the edge of spinning merry - go - round ... a gravity assist is like grabbing hold of the handle and getting some of that orbital speed before letting go ...","Great explanations by others , but keep in mind the manoeuvre can also be used to decelerate . Just depends whether you 're passing in front of the body ( relative to the direction of orbit ) or behind . Go in front to slow down , go behind to speed up . I hope that makes more sense , you ca n't just fly by a planet and expect greater speeds ."],"chatgpt_answers":["A gravity boost is a way to use the gravity of a planet to change the speed and direction of a spacecraft. Imagine you are on a playground swing and someone gives you a push to make you go higher. The same thing can happen with a spacecraft and a planet.\\n\\nWhen a spacecraft is close to a planet, the planet's gravity pulls on the spacecraft and makes it want to fall towards the planet. If the spacecraft is going fast enough, it will fall into orbit around the planet instead of crashing into it.\\n\\nBut if the spacecraft is going just the right speed and at just the right angle, it can use the planet's gravity to \"slingshot\" around the planet and change its speed and direction. This is called a gravity assist, or sometimes a gravity boost.\\n\\nFor example, if a spacecraft is heading towards Jupiter and wants to go faster, it can fly close to Jupiter and use the planet's gravity to give it a boost. As the spacecraft approaches Jupiter, the planet's gravity will pull on it and make it speed up. Then, as the spacecraft swings around the back side of the planet, it will be moving much faster than it was before.\\n\\nUsing gravity assists, spacecraft can travel to other parts of the solar system much faster and cheaper than they could by using their own engines alone."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"So basically the big planets like Jupiter have really strong gravity.

{"question":"Why do most societies associate sex with shame if it feels so good ? And why not other \" feel good \" stuff ? This post is assuming religion is human - made . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Prior to the development of reliable birth control , there were some pretty major consequences associated with sex ( stds , kids , etc ) . It was beneficial to discourage recreational sex , and shame is a good way achieve that . Nowadays sex is mostly safe , but society is slow to change and so those shameful attitudes still exist .","The short answer is STDs , once STDs become a major public health challenge then sexual activity must be curtailed and the use of shame is one of the best ways to control this . The best examples of this are isolated tribal people such Polynesian islanders . Until European sailors arrived they had a very open and accepting attitude to sexual activity . Once the STDs spread then that stopped . The second part is societies based on property and inheritance of that property . If you were going to spend many years raising a child then pass on your accumulated wealth then you want to be sure that it is your genetic off spring that is receiving this bounty . Hence the need for monogamous relationships , or the need for one brother to take care of the widow of a dead sibling . Untill the advent of birth control it became increasingly expensive to raise children , so stable families were required , as single women would struggle to meet the costs . It gets real interesting if you look at early medieval civilizations as they swarmed across Europe , the Saxons and later the Vikings practiced a from of genocide in conquered territory , all existing men and male children would be slaughtered , he women became chattel slaves but the offspring were considered the sons of the conquerors and could inherit . So another answer to you question might be that it helps to establish the patriarchy .","Because of the combination of big brains and walking upright , human babies are born quite immature compared to other animals ( e.g. puppies or kittens are walking in weeks and self - sufficient in months , but these things take multiple years for human babies ) . So human babies require a lot of resources to be invested , usually by the parents , since ( in biology terms of being able to propagate genes ) the parents of a child directly benefit from the child 's survival and prosperity . Each sex benefits from having a monogamous mate : If you 're male , the benefits of having a monogamous female are that the children you spend resources to raise are genetically yours . If you 're female , the benefits of having a monogamous male are that the male will continue to contribute his full resources to help you and your children during the pregnancy and long childhood . You do n't want him to divert some or all of his resources to another female and half - siblings of your children that carry his genes but not yours . Both sexes also have benefit from cheating and not being monogamous . If you 're male , cheating gives you extra children , more genetic diversity and more chances to spread your genes . If you 're female , cheating gives you more genetic diversity , allows you to take resources from multiple males , or \" trade up \" to a better provider if your current mate does n't have as many resources as some other male who 's attracted to you . So because of biology , it 's in a situation where everyone wants others to \" play by the rules \" while they have an incentive to cheat . It 's similar to the situation with property rights -- you want others to respect your own property rights , but you can gain private benefit if you ignore others ' property rights and steal their food and tools when they 're not paying attention . Sociologists and game theorists say that when such a situation happens , human societies will develop enforcement mechanisms to encourage everyone to \" play by the rules . \" Enforcement includes direct punishments ( adulterers are stoned , thieves go to jail ) and social norms ( do n't steal because it 's wrong , do n't have sex outside of approved monogamous relationships because it 's wrong ) . The feeling of shame is basically an emotion to help people live together in societies , by making you feel bad when you do something that would cause your society to reject you . There are a few other reasons , too . Of course normally wired humans are going to have sexual urges , and because of the social norms described above , they 're going to feel shame . The thing about shame is it makes you feel bad when you * might * be rejected by your society -- so one way you can get yourself to feel better is to convince some authority figure in your society that the society should overlook the thing that caused you to feel shame , and continue to accept you as a member . So that 's another reason why many religions emphasize that sexual urges should lead to shame -- because if people feel that shame , they will then turn to the priesthood for confession and absolution ( basically convincing the authority figure -- the priest -- that your society should continue to accept you despite your shameful sexual urges ) . It increases the religion 's power and influence if they 're the sole providers of a product that everyone needs . In this case , the product is a way for priests to relieve the feeling of shame that the priesthood itself has encouraged people to feel . In Catholicism you literally tell the priest \" This is how I am impure , forgive me Father \" and the priest says \" You are forgiven if you increase your devotion to the church by saying X prayers . \" In Protestantism it 's a more personal , inner dialog between yourself and Jesus / God , rather than a conversation with a priest , but it 's the same idea of \" I feel shame because I 've done something my society disapproves of , and I feel better because I 'm forgiven directly in this inner dialog with Jesus , the top authority figure of all Christianity . \" To address the last part of your question , I do n't know where you got the notion that societies do n't associate other things with shame . Think of the Ten Commandments in ancient times , or the Seven Deadly Sins in the Middle Ages . Murder and stealing are two things which are still uncontroversially wrong , and people are expected to feel shame . I can think of at least two of the Seven Deadly Sins that are non - sexual , and still expected to engender shame in 21st century America : - Greed : I suspect part of the reason some rich people contribute to charitable causes is trying to buy social approval for their pursuit of wealth -- arguably , the existence of philanthropy is evidence that our society associates the non - sexual feel - good phenomenon of greed with shame . - Gluttony : Everything from widespread practical concerns about the health consequences of obesity , to the prevalence of full - blown eating disorders and serious body - image issues , says that modern society relates the non - sexual feel - good activity of high - calorie food consumption to a feeling of shame . I could probably think of more , but this post is long enough as it is ."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are many reasons why different societies may associate sex with shame or view it as a private or taboo topic.

Also both are very flammable .","There are a few reasons . First of all , ca n't just combine hydrogen and oxygen , because they both form gases by chemically bonding with other atoms of the same type . That is , hydrogen atoms bond with other hydrogen atoms , and oxygen atoms bind with other oxygen atoms .

I do n't think you want to be carrying around explosive gases in pressurized containers when you could just carry around water . Also , one of the main ways to get hydrogen is by passing electric current through water to break it into hydrogen and oxygen . Essentially reverse - burning it .

Now the history of mathematics is filled with examples of us studying the type of problems we may see in our lives . How much material do I need to construct a fence around my field . How much stone do I need to build a pyramid . So a lot of the things we study are basically the abstractions of these type of problems , but there is nothing that necessarily makes that so . Now Mathematics is used in science mostly since it is good at showing the implications of structure and our universe has structure .

We find the things in nature such that we know some things , then we also MUST know these other things . Math is good at that .

They had a large population and needed the land more than a few measly farmers . The farmers recognized they were greatly outnumbered and called in assistance from the Australian Government . They sent in military aid in the form of a handful of soldiers and automatic weapons . The Gods showed kindness to the Emus and sent rain , slowing the soldiers down for a bit . On November 2nd the Great Emu war began . Soldiers set up a firing line , but because the Emus are so cunning they recognized this and stayed outside of the effective firing range of the enemy soldiers weapons . Local farmers were sent out to try and lure the Emus into the ambush , but the Emus knew the trap and broke down into small herds / teams to make themselves more difficult to target . Unfortunately nearly a dozens Emus lost their lives that day . On November 4th the Australian soldiers were able to successfully set up a ambush near the local dam , a place where Emus went to refresh themselves with drink and bathe . The Gods once again smiled upon the Emus , no more than 12 fell that day before the coward Australian soldier guns jammed , stopping their assault and giving the Emus time to escape . Various mistakes on the soldiers part gave great help to the Emus being able to outlast their opponents . On November 8th the Emus were able to successfully push back the Australians after a battle of attrition . The Australians wasted numerous resources on this engagement for little results . Because of their victory the Emus were embolden , and began attacking crops , they were looking to make the local farmers pay for their collaboration with the Australian soldiers . They came in the thousands , tearing up the country side . Once again in fear the farmers begged the government for assistance , after a 4 days rest on November 12th the Australian Government began military action once again .

In a proper democracy , the [ public would have decided immigration policy ] ( URL_0 ) in the first place . > And how did the perception that we live in a democracy begin ? By people who are both ignorant in their own country 's history and in the definition of democracy and republic . The US was formed as a republic to PREVENT democracy . * \" We are now forming a Republican form of government . Real liberty is not found in the extremes of democracy , but in moderate governments . If we incline too much to democracy we shall soon shoot into a monarchy , or some other form of a dictatorship . \" -Alexander Hamilton * * \" A democracy is nothing more than mob rule , where fifty - one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty - nine . \" -Thomas Jefferson * * \" pure democracies “ have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention ; have ever been incompatible with personal security or the rights of property ; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths . ” -James Madison *","There are some answers here that are focused on the historical context of the terms , and some that are just wrong . Here are two very brief definitions based on their structure : * * * Democracy * * comes from the greek words * demos * and * kratia * , meaning \" people \" and \" strength \" , respectively . It describes any political system where the populace under that system can collectively assert itself politically in any way ; this often takes the form of * * representative democracy * * , where the people elect representatives who perform the day - to - day business of government . * * * Republic * * comes from the latin phrase * res publica * , meaning \" public affair \" . A Republic is any government , country , or state where the government is legally associated with the will of the people , and in some cases may be synonymous * with * the people . It is opposed to private forms of state , especially most modern monarchies , where the government \" belongs \" to the sovereign and acts in their interests . * These two terms often intersect , but there is no reason they need to . The United Kingdom is a democratic state , but the government formally belongs to the queen : this is why it is strictly speaking \" Her Majesty 's Government \" and not the \" Government of the ( people of the ) United Kingdom \" . Likewise , what we would call the early Roman Empire was still a republic - there was no formal \" constitutional change \" that altered it from what we consider the \" true \" Republic - but power was concentrated in one man , who would come to be called \" Emperor \" in western history , who had attained every meaningful political office simultaneously and could override any other body , meaning it was not democratic ( strictly speaking , Ancient Rome was never really democratic by our modern standards , but in the Imperial period there was no mechanism for even the elite to collectively exert influence ) . * The United States of America is , arguably , both a republic and a democracy . Its government officially acts in the interests of the American people , and the vast majority of national political offices are filled through elections . * However , it is also a Federal government : while the government of the United States has power over the entire country , it shares that power with the 50 states , and these states ' governments are just as \" sovereign \" as the national government . The Federal Government in Washington DC can not take certain actions against individual states without violating the Constitution . The opposite of a Federal government is a Unitary government , such as the People 's Republic of China : while the PRC has granted many responsibilities to smaller regions like cities and provinces , it has no obligation to do so , and could revoke that responsibility at any time ; they are legally subordinate to Central People 's Government in Beijing . * Sometimes the term \" republic \" is viewed as referring only to unitary states , since the Federal Government \" belongs \" to its constituent parts instead of the people directly . That means that , instead of a single Democratic Republic , the United States could be considered a Democratic Federation of Democratic Republics . * Because the two major political parties in the US are the Democrats and the Republicans , there is some ( largely meaningless ) political squabbling over how the country is described in textbooks , with each party wanting to de - emphasize the other 's chosen term . Because the Democrats are not ideologically committed to Democracy and Republicans are not ideologically committed to Republicanism ( they support , * * very * * broadly speaking , social liberalism and conservative nationalism , respectively ) , this debate has very little to do with the actual meanings of the terms or their applicability to the modern United States . * EDIT : to answer your last question , it is generally agreed that the Founding Fathers sought to create a republican , democratic society as early as 1776 . They were primarily inspired by the Enlightenment , an 18th century intellectual movement against the absolute monarchies that dominated the western world at the time , which specifically embraced democracy and popular sovereignty ( i.e. , republicanism ) . * There was some conflict in the first few decades of the United States ' existence between the Democratic - Republicans ( led by Thomas Jefferson ) , who wanted a weak federal government and an anti - British foreign policy , and the Federalists ( led by Alexander Hamilton ) , who wanted a strong federal government modeled after Britain - where the President essentially acted as an elected monarch . Both groups advocated some elements of democracy be incorporated into society , however , and none of them opposed a republican government . Formally , Lincoln 's [ Gettysburg Address ] ( URL_0 ) 87 years later used the phrase \" government of the people , by the people , for the people \" , which is one of the best articulations of simultaneous republicanism and democracy .","I think this argument may be based on a slight misunderstanding of American history and a confusion of the different meanings of \" democracy \" . The first democracy was Athens in the 6th century BC , in which citizens were randomly chosen as officials , and all citizens formed the legislature ; today , we usually use \" democracy \" to mean any system of government which has ( more - or - less ) free and fair elections , the rule of law , and a respect for human rights in general . The confusion probably arises because at the time America gained its independence , \" democracy \" was a bit of a dirty word . It was synonymous with \" mob rule \" and described by some as \" the tyranny of the majority over the minority \" . The complicated system of US presidential elections , involving the infamous Electoral Colleges , was set up to keep the citizenry at arm 's length from actual government : they could have a say , but that say was filtered through the Electoral College to ensure they did n't elect a moron -- at least , that was the plan -- and to ensure that heavily populated states did n't consistently overrule less densely populated ones . So when non - Americans say things like , \" But surely , in a democracy , X and Y should be allowed ? \" they 're using the wider sense of \" a system of government that has elected leaders \" ; Americans , though , will recall their history lessons and counter that \" America is not a democracy , \" not realizing that 's true only in the negative sense of \" democracy \" as \" mob rule \" . Even so , \" democracy \" and \" republic \" are not quite synonymous .

Usually a number of bits , like 8 bits or 32 bits . A tape measure is a simple example of an analog to digital converter ( a physical one ) .

When working with microprocessors you often need to wait for your analog to digital conversion process to be finished as it takes a number of clock cycles for it to work out the value . [ Here 's an example circuit of what it could look like . ] ( URL_0 ) You start with an input voltage that is compared against a reference voltage by an operational amplifier . ( it basically is a comparator ) if the voltage on the + side is larger than the voltage on the - side the out put voltage will be high ( think of it as a binary 1 ) . you then feed this 1 to an Adding circuit . now we are in the digital world . The adding circuit has a \" clock \" signal put in it . Its a square wave . All this does is control when the the adder should add the inputs together and push it out . The clock will only do this on the high part of the square wave . The adder outputs a digital value ( 8 wires one for each bit ) , they are notated bundled together as a \" bus \" of 8 wires . Notice that the output of the adder is fed back to the input to the adder . What this means is that every time the clock actives an addition operation it adds the value of its last clock cycle with the output of the input comparator . This basically means it 's counting upward . Following the output of the adder downward you 'll see a series of resistors put together into another Operational Amplifier used in a completely different mode . This type of circuit is called a [ Summing Amplifier ] ( URL_1 ) and itself is a * * Digital - to - Analog * * Converter . The output of this circuit is fed back into itself as a form of feedback . As long as the feedback value is lower than the input value the comparator will be high voltage and the adder will see that as a 1 and keep adding one to the value . Once the feedback path is higher than the input path ( meaning its close enough to the reference ) the comparator will go to a low state ( or binary 0 ) . The adder circuit will just be adding 0 to the computed value . This can be passed into additional electronics and with the output of the added to tell other components that the Analog to Digital conversion is complete .","Computer engineer here . ADCs and DACs are extremely common parts of modern electronics . There are a variety of designs for each but that 's a bit beyond the scope of ELI5 so I 'll leave that bit up to you should you choose to do so . An ADC takes as an input three * continuous * values : 1 . A minimum voltage 2 . A maximum voltage 3 . An input voltage The minimum and maximum voltage are used to calibrate the range of output values . A very common minimum voltage is 0 volts , and a very common maximum voltage is 5 volts . An ADC produces one * discrete * output value in digital form which is an arbitrary number of bits in length . The greater the number of bits , the greater the precision of the device ; the more precise the device is , the less information is lost . Consider a rather simple linear 2 - bit ADC with an input voltage range of 0v-5v . Since this ADC outputs two bits , there are four possible binary outputs : 00,01,10,11 . In base 10 these are just 0,1,2,3 . Since this ADC is linear , each output symbol is linearly spaced across the range of input values . A 5 volt range divided by four possible outputs yields a precision of 1.25 volts . Non - linear ADCs / DACs are useful when greater precision is necessary only in a certain range ; a good example is a telephone conversation , telephonic ADCs / DACs are non - linear as they are designed to capture speaking amplitude . An input in the range of [ -inf,1.25 ) volts will result in an output of 00 . An input in the range of [ 1.25,2.5 ) volts will result in an output of 01 . An input in the range of [ 2.5,3.75 ) volts will result in an output of 10 . An input in the range of [ 3.75,inf ] volts will result in an output of 11 . Note that good circuit design should never permit the input voltage to fall below the minimum set point or rise above the maximum set point . How each ADC responds to this is defined by each manufacturer . Whereas our 2 - bit ADC has only four possible outputs for an infinite number of inputs , an 8 - bit ADC has 256 possible outputs for an infinite number of inputs , and a 16 bit ADC has 65,536 possible outputs for an infinite number of inputs .

{"question":"Why are the front of a lot of city buses a flat square ? Is nt that the least aerodynamic shape there is ? Seems like they re so heavy anyway they 'd try and save fuel . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["A more aerodynamic shape would help fuel efficiency some , but not that much for two reasons . First , buses do n't travel that fast and drag ( air resistance in this case ) becomes a bigger deal at higher velocity . Second , there are two different types of drag : drag from pushing air out of the way and drag from air passing over the surface of the vehicle . For a short car , there is n't much surface for air to pass over so pretty much all of the drag comes from pushing air out of the way . That 's also the sort of drag an aerodynamic shape helps with . For a long vehicle like a bus , drag from air passing over its surface area is a bigger deal . There 's still more overall drag on a bus from having to push air out of the way , but skin drag is a much bigger component than it is for cars . This makes the drag from having to push air out of the way in the front less important for buses . Those are just reasons why an aerodynamic shape wo n't help a bus as much , though ; they 're not reasons to not do it . The reason buses are designed with a flat front is that it maximizes volume and a flat front and window allow the driver to see better , especially when turning . The increased space and visibility are more important than any small increase in efficiency from a more aerodynamic shape . tl;dr - Buses benefit less from aerodynamics because of their long shape and they would be hurt by a more aerodynamic shape because a flat front maximizes space and driver visibility . Edit : In response to the multiple comments saying that some buses go fast , we know that . But most buses do not and when buses are designed it 's usually not clear exactly how they 'll be used . And even for the ones that get on the freeway , the flat front is better for volume and for turning once the bus inevitably leaves the freeway .","Aerodynamics took a back seat to maneuverability on downtown streets where corners tend to be more square and congested . If transit buses were built like school buses the nose would swing way into oncoming traffic when making turns . Flat front buses have the front wheels behind the driver and closer to the rear axle so the turning radius is greatly reduced . Source : drove city bus for five years , like flat fronts more . Edit : spelling and front wheel tweak .","Interior space efficiency is more important than exterior aerodynamic profile in busses as they generally travel at low speed . Aerodynamic drag increases as the square of velocity , so at low speeds it is less important . A more aerodynamic nose shape generally requires an overall \" pointier \" shape , which means you can generally fit less into it inside . This space could be used to fit more seats , so the bus can haul more people in the same foorprint . So at a low speed where aerodynamic drag is almost negligible , interior packaging profile is prioritized . It 's also a maintenance issue . Flat parts are also easy and cheap to both make and replace , much more so than contoured aerodynamic shapes . Busses hit things and get hit fairly often , so having cheap exterior panels is a big plus . Long haul and tour busses that travel for extended times at speed make more of an effort at aerodynamics , by adding some rake angle to the forward face and having more contoured panels . But the lower the speed the bus operates at , the higher the priority of packaging and ease of construction / maintenance , hence simple flat faced city busses ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The front of a city bus is typically a flat square shape because it allows the driver to have a clear view of the road and pedestrians in front of the bus. The shape of the front of the bus also makes it easier for people to see the bus coming, which can help to improve safety.\\n\\nWhile it is true that a more aerodynamic shape might be more fuel efficient, city buses are generally not designed for high speeds and do not need to be as aerodynamic as other vehicles. Additionally, city buses are typically quite heavy and have large engines, so they are able to overcome the extra drag caused by the shape of their front ends.\\n\\nOverall, the main priority for the design of a city bus is safety and functionality, rather than fuel efficiency."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, little one, the front of city buses being flat has more to do with safety than fuel efficiency.

Also, buses have something called a \"revolving sign\" up front that often contains important information that needs to be changed frequently, such as the route"}

An example would be telling an Asian person , \" Wow ! You speak English surprisingly well , \" even though they could very well be from an English - speaking country . Something blatantly racist , such as refusing to hire anybody who 's a member of a certain race , would not count as a microagression . Curiosity : Asking about something you genuinely do n't understand . It does n't necessarily have to have any implications of a person being intolerant or prejudiced . There can be some overlap between the two , such as when someone asks about something stereotypical . An example would be saying to a black person , \" Do you people really eat a lot of fried chicken and watermelon ? \" if they actually believe that that 's what members of that race eat . The categorization is really just based on whether the comment has stereotypical / racist implications . However , the terms are by no means mutually exclusive .","A note ahead of time : I do n't really like the phrase \" microaggression . \" Personally , I think microagressions essentially boil down to being a rude or clumsy conversationalist , and sociologists just felt like coining a new buzzword so they attached a marginalization component to it .

I want to drill down on one specific aspect of its operations . If you talked to anyone at Twitter , they would actually tell you that they made a net profit this last quarter : > * Q4 GAAP net loss of $ 167 million and * * non - GAAP net income of $ 119 million * * . ^(_- from their SEC filings , emphasis mine _ ) That 's quite a big difference ! What is this GAAP and non - GAAP business and why does it give such wildly different profit models ? Herein lies one of the costliest aspect of Twitter 's operation : * * employee retention * * . This is a well - known secret within the tech industry , and it is somewhat peculiar that a ( relatively , by the tech standard ) mature company has to spend so much money to keep a reasonable tenure rate that it 's pushing their profit margins into the black hemisphere . * * GAAP vs OLD NAVY * * GAAP and non - GAAP are two different accounting models that the CFO and his analysts use to compile Twitter 's financials . In simple terms , GAAP is the model that the security exchange wants , and the non - GAAP model basically takes some of the expenses of running Twitter , and reasons that they are \" self - reinvesting \" enough that they should n't be accounted for as an expense altogether . For Twitter , their non - GAAP trick is to magically erase the impact of \" Stock - based compensation expense \" and \" restructuring changes \" . In other words , they do n't believe that their accountants should really care about what they have to pay their employees to show up everyday because that 's not really reflective of whether they will succeed . Of course , this raises several questions . * * Why would anyone care about the no - compensation model in the first place ? * * Compensation is as much of a cost of operations as RnD , servers , physical assets , or a host of other expenses required to keep Twitter chugging along . This is obviously the opinion of the SEC as well , so why does Twitter even think it can get away with reporting a , quote , \" non - GAAP net income of $ 119 million \" ? Well , it turns out that there is some precedence for evaluating a company 's * potential * even when they are not profitable . For many early companies , shelling out for good talent from time to time ( or during growth sprees ) is n't really an ominous thing . Nevertheless , standard accounting of their financials would lead your shareholders to believe that , because Foofle brought on an expensive director this year , its profit suffered . For healthy companies , excluding these expenses actually can give shareholders more clarity on the long - term direction of their company . So far everything seems reasonable , but there 's more to Twitter than meets the eye . * * Why are Twitter 's financials peculiar ? * * Well , it 's actually not that difficult to answer . Including both stock compensation and restructuring fees , Twitter spends around $ 240 m to make sure that their employees keep coming into work every morning . With a total revenue of $ 700 m , that 's over a third of its total revenue ! ( For reference , Facebook , who pays the third most to retain employees , only pays out 15 % of their total revenue ) No other comparable companies in that vertical , or even in tech in general , spends that much to keep their employees . Why is Twitter having trouble here ? Well , the fact of the matter is , the RSUs ( stock units / shares in Twitter ) that the company grants to its employers is losing value every quarter . If you look at the historical price per share since Twitter went public , it 's been dipping monotonically . As a result , the shares that were granted to an employee is only worth a fraction of the prices that they are worth when they were granted . ( Some of this depends on the technicality of how those shares vest / when they can be sold ) . Obviously , people are generally not very happy when they are holding what appears to be a depreciating asset . As a result , to keep their employees happy , Twitter will re - issue refresher stocks each year to compensate for the depreciation in the value of their equity , as well as a bit extra as a bonus ( probably ) . So what 's wrong with that ? Nothing . It 's just that Twitter 's performing so poorly that , to keep their compensation competitive , they 're actually eating up a third of its revenue in order to keep their engineers , their strategist , and their other employees happy . But there 's some good news for Twitter at least . This percentage of total revenue that goes towards employee retention is declining every year ( it was about 50 % back in 2014 ) . For the most part , this is mostly due to increasing revenue . However , if they become GAAP profitable and beat earnings , their stock prices will probably go up . At that point , their employees stocks will suddenly become an appreciating asset . As a result , they 'll probably also stop bleeding so much money out to compensation .","It costs money to maintain the business as well as expand and grow .

We can represent this as \"a + b = ?\", where the question mark stands for the answer we're trying to find.\\n\\nStep 3: Since \"a\" and \"b\" are both odd numbers, we know that they both cannot be divided evenly by 2. This means that when we add them together, the result will also not be divisible by 2.\\n\\nStep 4: In math, we use the term \"even\" to describe numbers that are divisible by 2, and \"odd\" to describe numbers that are not divisible by 2. Since the result of adding \"a\" and \"b\" is not divisible by 2, we can say that it is an \"odd\" number.\\n\\nStep 5: However, we also know that the sum of any two odd numbers is always even. This means that our original assumption (that the sum of any two odd numbers is always even) must be true.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up, a math proof is a way of showing that something is true by starting with a set of assumptions and using logical steps to arrive at a conclusion."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Alright young child, mathematics may seem complicated at times but a math proof is just a way for guys and gals to use their thumbs or tools like pens used to calculate to describe and explain how something in math definitively works.

When you see a rainbow , you are seeing the light from the sun separated out into the various colors . The thing is , our eyes only see some of the light that comes from the sun . A rainbow has light we ca n't see in the area outside the violet part and also light we ca n't see outside the red part . The light just outside the violet part of the rainbow is what we call ultraviolet ( black light ) , and the part just outside the red is infra - red . The main way that black light is produced these days is through those tube - based black light lamps you see that are violet colored . They are basically just fluorescent lamps . The way they work is that they have electrodes on either end of the tube , and the tube is filled with a gas ( usually argon ) and some mercury vapor . Electricity passes through the electrodes and through the gas and pumps energy into the gas , exciting it . The gas will release the energy , and when it does so , it releases it as light . The color of the light released is very specific and depends on the particular chemicals used . The reason that mercury is in these lamps is that when you excite it in this way , it will release a lot of its light in the ultraviolet band . Mercury produces light at some other colors ( as does the argon ) , too ... so the tube is colored to filter out some of that light and leave just the violet and ultraviolet light . By the way , fluorescent lights you might have in the home or office work on the same principle , but with an addition . The white \" paint \" you see on the tube is a chemical coating ( phosphors ) which absorb ultraviolet light and then release that energy back as visible light . The coating works on the same principle as those glowing paints you see that react to black light . Another way that black light can be produced now is through LEDs . That technology is fairly new , I believe . Frankly , I do n't know enough about the physics of LEDs to explain how they work .

Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["It 'll be helpful to have some context so you can understand these relationships . Many books could be written on all this , but I 'm going to simplify greatly . Let 's start with the aftermath of WWII . The US emerged from the war a nuclear superpower and Russia(which was part of the Soviet Union ) would become one soon after . They engaged in the Cold War where they fought a series of proxy wars against each other(Afghanistan , Vietnam , etc . ) , but never fully engaged in large scale warfare because to do so might mean the end of the world . In the 1990s the Soviet Union fell apart , but decades of tension still influence Russia and America 's relationship . The collapse of the Soviet Union brought chaos and a major loss of prestige for Russia . China was engaged in a civil war before and after WWII(they united to fight the Japanese during the war ) . The Communists backed by Russia won and the losing side backed by the Americans fled to Taiwan . Both sides to this day claim to be the true government of China . China has often threatened to attack Taiwan and wants to claim the island as its territory . America supports and sells weapons to Taiwan , which is a constant source of tension between the countries . China and America fought each other during the Korean War , which is unfortunately largely forgotten in America , but it is taught to Chinese as an example of the Chinese standing up to the West . It 's important to understand that there was a period in time before the rise of the Communists where Western nations + Japan bullied China and basically did what they want(Ex . Opium Wars ) . The memories of these humiliations still influences Chinese policy . Russia and communist China were allies till the Sino - Soviet split where they struggled with who would control the communist world . The Chinese and Russians would n't really get back on speaking terms till the late 80s . The Americans had tried to isolate China as much as possible and even made sure Taiwan got China 's seat on the Security Council at the UN . They saw the split as an opportunity to weaken the Soviet Union . Nixon visited China and in a decade the relationship between the US and China would normalize , so the two countries soon began to trade . With China 's cheap but plentiful supply of labor , the economy expanded greatly . Many Americans have come to view this is a detriment to the economy and the US has a pretty big trade deficit with China . With China 's rise , people have come to view it as the next big threat to the country . Some Americans say that the Chinese economy grows each year at US 's expense , the military becomes better and more advanced , and China is becoming aggressive and claiming large amounts of territory . They view war as an inevitability . Others view China as a paper tiger that has a bunch of hidden debt , and once the economy stops growing at a fast pace , the people will no longer tolerate the lack of certain freedoms and the whole thing will come crashing down . Many Americans still view the Russians as a threat . Their aggression in the Ukraine and possible involvement in the 2016 election are a sign of things to come . Other Americans think this is an exaggeration and some think that Putin is an ally in the fight against chaos developing in the world(ex . ISIS ) . Russians and Chinese both tend to think of Americans as hypocrites and self - righteous . \" You 're complaining about us taking Crimea when you invaded Iraq ! \" They view the American political system is flawed . Despite this , there is an element of respect from citizens of both countries for America 's accomplishments , and they admire the respect for the rule of law and relative stability of the country , which is why many immigrate here .

This region was given to the Teutonic Knights during the Crusades to fight against the native Baltic pagans , which was the first German state in the region of Prussia . Fast forward a few hundred years and Prussia is now the largest and most powerful of the many German states , comprising the aforementioned territory along the Baltic sea and roughly the northern half of modern - day Germany . In 1871 the German states unified into the German Empire ( minus Austria , which already had an empire of its own ) with the Prussians dominant ; the Prussian king Wilhelm I became Kaiser and the Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck became Chancellor . After Germany lost World War I the Treaty of Versaille forced them to give up most of the territory in Prussia proper , giving it to the restored states of Poland and Lithuania , as well as Russia . Much of the German - speaking population left or was expelled .","Germany has n't existed as a nation state for a very long time . If you go back just a couple hundred years or so , while most of Europe had got the hang of it and formed countries like England , France and Denmark , the German - speaking lands were still a patchwork of tiny kingdoms , principalities , duchies and other territories , as in [ this map showing the situation in the early 17th century ] ( URL_1 ) . These territories were constantly changing and shifting , battles and wars flared up , ruling dynasties married into one another or divided into different branches , and so on ; but they were loosely organized as the \" Holy Roman Empire \" . Starting in the mid-17th century , two powers became dominant in German - speaking countries : Brandenburg - Prussia in the north and Austria in the south . As Prussia gradually became larger and larger , swallowing up more and more microstates right across northern Germany , the smaller states found themselves squeezed between these two superpowers . The French Revolution upset the political situation in central and western Europe , and led to the Napoleonic Wars which brought about the end of the Holy Roman Empire : this was replaced by a closer union called the [ German Confederation ] ( URL_2 ) , in which Prussia dominated the north , and Austria and Bavaria the south . The Confederation failed fairly quickly . Prussia and the northern states formed the North German Confederation , with Prussia now by far the dominant political and military power . The goal was the unification of all , or most , of the German - speaking lands into a single nation state . It was the Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck who achieved this , except that he did n't want his hated enemy Austria to join . To this end , he provoked ( or at least took advantage of ) a number of wars : the Second War of Schleswig , the Austro - Prussian War ( which shifted power from Austria to Prussia ) and the Franco - Prussian War ( to unite all the other southern German - speaking states against a common enemy ) . The result was the German Empire , which was founded in 1871 , with Prussia as one of its provinces ( the grey area on [ this map ] ( URL_0 ) . ) Prussia no longer exists as an entity , but some of the things you may associate with Germany -- spiked helmets , ruthless efficiency , militaristic zeal , stiff formality -- come from the upper classes of Prussian society .

","human_answers":["* * TL;DR : Lots of reasons . * * * Certain fruits and veggies are highly seasonal and light for their weight and require careful handling and importing from outside the country . Meat 's easier to keep growing through the winter using local government - assisted jobs so grocery stores can access massive quantities and sell it at a reduced price . * Fruits and vegetables do n't grow outside in colder weather , and many have very limited growing seasons coupled with limited shelf life . So you either have to grow them in a warm climate that 's far away and then invest in rapidly shipping them in a temperature - controlled container until they arrive , or grow them in a regional warmed greenhouse or hydroponics farm . Both options are expensive and add to the cost . A lot of fruit and vegetables bruise very easily and are filled with air ( peppers are a good example ) . So you have to ship them in protective containers that do n't really contain much weight compared to their volume . This adds to their cost compared the small volume for each pound of , say , pork that comes in . There are no seasonal limitations on growing many meats . Pig sties and chicken farms run throughout the year , feeding their animals through locally grown crops that keep really well like dried corn . Do it right and you can get several harvests of chicken each year . However , strawberries and asparagus really only grow once per year in a certain season . Getting those products out of season usually means they 've been shipped from far overseas . Stores put on sales according to supply and demand . In your chicken versus grapes example , they were able to buy a massive quantity of local chicken at a cheap price , and they were willing to let it go at less of a profit per package because everyone 's buying it and then buying other things in their store too . There 's no massive quantity of grapes being routinely harvested in winter , so there 's no sale on those and the store 's getting full profit on each bunch they sell . And finally , as someone else mentioned , sometimes regional governments interfere in the price - setting elements of \" supply and demand \" , charging tariffs and taxes on imported good while subsidizing locally produced ones .","Because growing grain and giving it to chickens is n't as expensive as you 'd think , and because the government gives subsidies to chicken and beef producers .","Cows and chickens are n't eating red peppers and grapes , first off ... they are eating corn , soy , other cheap grains that are also less perishable .

{"question":"Why 0 degrees Kelvin is physically impossible to reach but negative temperatures are not . EDIT : Thanks for the replies , everybody ! Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Negative temperatures are n't literally colder than positive temperatures , when referred to in this regard . In fact a negative kelvin temperature is hotter than a positive kelvin temperature . The issue here is there are two references to ' negative ' when we talk about temperature . Negative in something like Celsius , refers simply to a temperature below what we have arbitrarily chosen as 0 somewhere on the scale . There 's not a fundamental difference between -1 and +1 Celsius . There 's less heat at -1 , but there 's still ' some amount of energy being measured . ' On Kelvin , however , zero is taken as an absolute . There 's no energy at 0 . you ca n't go to ' less than nothing . ' In this case , a negative temperature refers to a system where entropy decreases as we add energy , as opposed to a system where entropy increases . Not a value ' colder ' than 0 .","Here 's the thing about negative Kelvin temperatures : yes , they are \" below \" absolute zero . But that 's because physicists use a different definition of temperature than we do . In the everyday world and in basic - level scientific stuff , \" temperature \" is a measure of molecular motion . The hotter something is , the more its molecules vibrate . Absolute zero is the point at which all molecular motion stops . You ca n't go below that , because there 's no such thing as \" less than zero \" motion . But in advanced physics , temperature is defined differently . There 's a more important property called [ thermodynamic beta ] ( URL_0 ) , and temperature is the inverse of this . Thermodynamic beta ( colloquially called \" coldness \" ) is the rate at which a system 's entropy changes when you add a bit of energy to it . It 's also sometimes called * perk * , because it 's a measure of how much a system \" perks up \" when you add energy to it . \" Negative temperature \" really means negative beta , negative coldness . This is when a system gets * so * hot , so chaotic , that adding energy into it actually decreases its entropy , making it more ordered .","There are two ways of thinking about temperature : 1 . \" Common sense \" - temperature describes the average kinetic energy of the components of the system . 2 . Thermodynamics - mathematically temperature can be thought of more abstractly as relating the energy of a system and its entropy ( \" disorder \" ) . Think of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a gas . This temperature can never be negative because a molecule ca n't have negative kinetic energy . It is theoretically possible to cool something to 0 K , but it gets harder and harder to get there in practice . The lowest temperature anyone has ever measured is around 1.0e-10 K or 0.0000000001 K. In normal systems , increasing the temperature increases the energy and increases the entropy with it . In certain quantum mechanical systems , increasing the energy can decrease the entropy . Mathematically , this can be described as a \" negative \" temperature . But this \" negative \" temperature is not negative in the first sense . A system with a \" negative \" temperature actually has MORE energy than one with positive temperature . Example : in a chunk of semiconductor , there are \" bands \" of energy levels available to electrons . The electrons can have kinetic energy , but they also have potential energy depending on which band they 're in . At 0 K temperature all the electrons are in the lowest possible energy levels and the entropy is low . As you heat the material up , some of the electrons are excited to higher energy bands and some stay behind . The entropy increases as you heat the semiconductor because the electrons are spread out across many more energy levels than before . If you keep heating the semiconductor , eventually all of the electrons are excited out of the lowest band and into the next band . Now all the electrons are distributed across a smaller range of energy levels . So now the entropy ( \" disorder \" ) has decreased even though we 've heated the semiconductor . This decrease in entropy with increasing energy can be described mathematically as \" negative temperature \" even though the chunk of material is actual WAY HOTTER than 0K."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure!

And no matter which website you go to , the speed at which you receive the data ( load the website , stream the audio or video ) will be the same . Without net neutrality , the ISP is free to decide at which speeds you 're going to be receiving data from various sites .

And Netflix has one as well . In this case it 's a very good idea for TW to throttle the bandwith of Netflix to a point where it 's no longer possible for you to watch Netflix .

{"question":"Object Oriented Programming Languages OOP VS procedural and why everyone says its such an important concept for me to understand ; but then ca nt give a clear description of either or why ? Thanks ! Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["I actually had to explain this to my 5 year old . A procedural program is like a recipe . If you want to make a cake you take the recipe and do each step . Sometimes the steps refer to other recipes ( like the icing ) ; we call those \" methods \" . And there are amounts of things you have ( like cups of flour ) ; we call those variables . Now let 's say you were baking a 8 course meal . You 'd have a ton of recipes ( methods ) and amounts of stuff ( variables ) to keep track of . Object Oriented Programming ( OOP ) is a way of organizing the methods and variables to keep everything together . An object is a thing ( a noun ) and you attach variables ( usually called properties ) and methods ( verbs ) . The object keeps all of that stuff together and makes sure that you do n't mix up your cake recipe with another one . But one important takeaway is that these are not mutually exclusive . Most ( but not all ) OOP languages are procedural , and a lot ( but not all ) procedural languages offer OOP .","Note that in the following examples , I 'm using pretty standard OOP terminology , but things may vary by language . The basic idea of OOP is that you describe your program as a set of objects , each of which have their own data and behavior . For example , a game might have a Player object containing the data \" health \" , \" speed \" , and \" strength \" , and containing the behaviors \" Move with keyboard input \" , \" lose health ( and possibly die ) \" , and \" drink health potion \" . Now let 's say we want to add AI players , or networked players . Suddenly we need our Player class to be more flexible ! The \" Move with keyboard input \" behavior is no longer acceptable . One simple way to solve this is to make Player into something called a \" base \" class : replace \" Move with keyboard input \" with the more generic \" Move with some kind of input \" , then create \" child classes \" called HumanPlayer , NetworkedPlayer , and AIPlayer that all handle their \" Move with some kind of input \" in different ways . This is known as \" inheritance \" : defining child classes that act like a special version of the base , or \" parent \" , class . Alongside inheritance is \" polymorphism \" and \" encapsulation \" . Your game could store a list of \" Player\"s , each of which is one of the child Player types , and call each of their \" Move with some kind of input \" without caring which type each Player actually is ! If you want a new networked player , just add a new NetworkedPlayer to the list -- the game does n't care what kind of Player he is ; it just runs his behaviors like it would with any other Player . In other words , the responsibility of handling all that player 's networking code is \" encapsulated \" in the NetworkedPlayer class , so nobody else has to worry , care , or even * know * about it . This is the main advantage of OOP : a powerful way of grouping code so that other groups of code only have to care about the outward interface it exposes , not everything that might be going on underneath . Edit : typos","These are not really different things . Almost all languages are procedural . Procedural refers to procedures . You can think of your code as being one procedure , with maybe sub - procedures in it . Procedure being one set of instructions that your computer follows . Typical example is a recipe , that 's a procedure of sorts . Your CPU , at its core , works like this , so most languages derive procedural nature of theirs from CPU . However , once you start building these complex procedures(think of 1,000 page long recipes with cross - references ) , you 'll notice that it 's actually darn difficult to safely change any section of the recipe and still have any sort of prediction about what is gon na happen next . If you change one sub - procedure(sub - recipe that may or may not be referenced from elsewhere ) , you 're gon na have to go through all the 1,000 pages with care to make sure none of those pages suddenly stop making sense as a result of your one change . OOP is a proposed solution to this . It packs sub - procedures with the data they handle into Objects . This means when you make changes into some sub - procedure , you only have to check the pages dealing with this object . You can , by purposefully programming so that you refrain from referencing to data outside selected pages , do Object - Oriented Programming even with programming languages that are purely procedural with no Object - Oriented Programming support . OOP languages exist to help programming this way , packing data and procedures that handle that data together . But the big key thing here is that you will have limited access to all Data , which is managed by objects , so that if data is corrupt , that must be because of the limited number of functions that are allowed to handle that data ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming are two different ways of organizing and writing code.\\n\\nIn procedural programming, the focus is on writing a list of instructions for the computer to follow, step by step. This can be a useful way to solve problems, but it can also be inflexible and hard to modify or reuse.\\n\\nIn OOP, the focus is on creating \"objects\" that represent real-world things, and then writing code to make those objects behave in certain ways. For example, you might create a \"Dog\" object that has properties like \"name,\" \"breed,\" and \"age,\" and methods like \"bark\" and \"fetch.\" This can make it easier to understand and work with complex programs, because you can think about the problem in terms of the objects and their relationships, rather than just a long list of instructions.\\n\\nOOP is often considered a more important concept to understand because it is a more flexible and modular way of programming, which can make it easier to write and maintain complex programs.

Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Space is n't dark . Space is * empty * . You only see colors because light from the Sun is reflecting off of stuff here on Earth , or stuff in the atmosphere . But space is basically just emptiness , so there 's nothing to reflect off of , thus it just appears black .","> Should n't it get lighter the closer you get to the sun ? ? There is plenty of light in space , but there is n't air to reflect it to your eyes . This means it passes right by without being seen and appears black .","Despite huge number of twinkling and bright stars , sky looks dark . It appears intriguing and unexplainable . But this is not the actual situation . In order to simplify the matter , it would be prudent to understand the stars , galaxies and the rays of light . Sun , in our galaxy called Milky Way , is a moderate star . However there are stars bigger , heavier and radiating more energy in the galaxies . A galaxy is a cluster of stars . There are 100000000000 or 10 raised to the power eleven stars in a galaxy or Milky Way . There are 100000000000 or ten raised to the power eleven galaxies in the universe . That makes 10 raised to the power 22 ( or twenty two zeros proceeding one ) stars in this universe . This is a very huge astronomical figure . But despite such large number shining stars , there is darkness in the sky at night . Why is it so ? I am not considering the reflection from moon which lit the sky at night . 2 . The probable answer would be that these stars are distantly situated and can not contribute to illumination of sky . But what stops light rays from huge number of stars from illuminating the sky ? That may seem a bit technical question . To understand this , it would be better , to know in brief , the law governing these heavenly bodies . Hubble , an astrophysicist , gave the world law of recession of heavenly bodies . This law states , heavenly bodies recede from each other with velocity directly proportional to its distance . That means , as the distance will increase , the velocity increases . This velocity at the most can tend to reach that of light as per Einstein . Einstein stated that maximum achievable velocity is velocity of light and nothing can surpass this velocity . That means maximum achievable velocity for cosmological bodies would be velocity of light . It is obvious if the bodies were moving with the velocity of light , the Rays from these would not be able to reach us . We thus can not see these . We can only see or detect those cosmological bodies whose velocity are less than that of light . Such galaxies which have velocities less than that of light , will fall in the universe visible to us . With the passage of time as velocities of such bodies tend to approach that of light , these would be out of our visible universe and beyond our detection . Visible universe is , therefore , losing those bodies whose velocities get increased to that of light with passage of time . 3 . It is an admitted fact that ordinarily , all stars emit light rays , but these rays travel huge distances to reach earth . The distances traversed by the rays can be judged from the fact that rays take 4.67 years to reach here from our neighbouring nearest star Alpha Centauri . Stars situated even more distantly also exist in galaxies and these may take thousands of years for the rays to reach here . The journey of the rays from the source stars is not easy and smooth . The rays after emission from the stars pass through intervening some massive and some moderate stars . The rays when near the gravitating massive stars , get bent or attracted to the star and lose a part of their energy . These thus get red shifted . In addition , the relative receding motion between the star and the sun also causes a red URL_0 understand the red shift , it is submitted that a ray of light can be split into light of seven colours . This splitting can be done by glass prism or spectrometer . These colours of light denote its energy bands . These seven colours can be remembered by the word , ‘ VIBGYOR ’ where V stands for violet , I for indigo , B for blue , G for green , Y for yellow , R for red Rays of light . That is the energy of the rays from their colours , violet to red is in descending order . When rays are deflected towards gravitating heavy star , their energy get decreased and the rays are shifted towards red band in spectrum . This deflection of light rays due to the gravitating star is similar to that in optical lens and gives rise to the image of the star causing confusion in the location of the real star . This phenomenon is called gravitational lensing . In addition to this , the relative motion between the source star and the sun on account of recession , also causes an appreciable amount of red shift due to Doppler ’s effect . Because of high red shifting , the rays fall in infra red zone and are too weak to illuminate the sky . 4 . As submitted above , the rays traverse large distances , these pass through intergalactic gases , dust etc . That causes absorption of the rays and this further weaken the energy . At the same time , the rays are also blocked by the intervening stars and that also reduces their energy . The rays then possess the energy far lower than that at the time of their emission from the source star . 5 . Also flux density of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between source and destination , larger distance will reduce the flux density to larger extent . As stated earlier the distances of stars from the sun in some cases , is thousands of light years , therefore , flux density gets appreciably weak . 6 . It is also submitted that some stars emit light for some duration and then these do not . Therefore , light rays are available to the extent t / t ’ where t ’ is time from Big Bang and t is time during which it emitted light . That also reduces the flux density . 7 . Without going into details of the Big Bang , I submit that expansion took place after after Big Bang and energy converted to mass . But relic of Big Bang is still present in the universe in the form of cosmic microwave background or CMB . Hot photons cooled down and reached that temperature which was in thermal equilibrium with matter . The result is 2.7 K microwaves . These CMB is still present in the universe equally at day and night . But these are not strong enough to illuminate the sky . This is also called Olbers ’ Paradox . 8 . Summing up , it is submitted that despite huge number of stars , obstructions by intervening stars to rays , absorption of rays by galactic gases and dust , exponential reduction of flux density due to large distances between source and the sun , intervention to the rays by massive stars , reduce the energy and the rays are highly red shifted to the extent of infra red band . CMB , a relic of Big Bang , is too weak to illuminate the sky . Thus though 10000000000000000000000 stars twinkle yet these can not illuminate the sky .

{"question":"What is a computer ' memory leak ' ? I see it 's a huge issue with PC software but have no clue what it means . Can someone kindly explain it to me in simple terms please Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Modern operating systems let you run multiple programs at once , but you only have one pool of RAM that they all have to share . The way that works is that when a program wants memory , it asks the operating system for however much it needs , and the OS finds a block that 's not being used and loans it to the program . When the program is done using the memory , it 's supposed to return it so other programs can use it . A memory leak happens when a program forgets about a block of memory the operating system gave it . As far as the operating system is concerned , it still has that block \" checked out \" , but the program ca n't do anything with it , and it ca n't return it back to the operating system because it ca n't find it . The memory is n't gone permanently- when the program exits , the operating system knows it does n't need the memory any more so it marks all the memory that was checked out by the program as \" available \" again . But it 's not going to be available as long as that program is still running . It 's only a big problem if the program keeps doing this . If it keeps hitting the code where it asks for more memory , but never returns any of it . Since it 's not giving any memory back , the program will , over time , consume more and more of your computer 's memory until you do n't have any more memory to give it . At that point , the computer has three choices : 1 . It can start rejecting requests from programs that ask for more memory ( which generally results in those programs crashing ) 2 . It can try storing additional data on the hard drive , which keeps the computer running but is something like 1000x slower than RAM so your computer will slow to a crawl 3 . It can try to figure out which program is stealing all of the memory and terminate that one ( Linux does this , Mac and Windows do n't since some programs do n't deal well with not having time to clean up ) EDIT : formatting","Software developer here , Memory is a finite resource , your computer has only so much of it . Every program needs memory , and it 's use has to be coordinated to ensure no two programs overwrite each other . That coordination typically happens through the OS as the mediator between all other programs and memory . Every program keeps track of what memory addresses it 's using . Typically , when a program needs memory , it will request what it needs , and when it 's done with that memory , it will release it back into the pool of available memory . Most programs , it 's the responsibility of the programmer to allocate and free the memory . Oversights are common , and an algorithm may allocate memory without releasing it when finished . The OS does n't know the program is done with that memory , it does n't know there 's an error that is allocating without releasing memory , and the program error may be such that the program loses track of which bytes it no longer needs , and now it ca n't release it back to the OS . This is a memory leak . The pool of memory is slowly draining . This can bog down your system until the offending process is killed and the allocated memory can be reclaimed , if other processes do n't themselves start failing .","I think the best ELI5 would be to equate a computer as a teacher , and computer programs as little students .

For example , I have prevented very serious problems by contacting doctors over a dangerously high dose of antibiotics in a child , or a drug interaction that was only meaningful because it was for a frail elderly lady . This is a pharmacist 's job - doctors are trained for diagnosis , not drug interactions . - I help people understand their medications . For example , the man who just had a heart attack and is leaving the hospital overwhelmed with a pile of meds . Without me they usually will stop taking one or two ( or go back to smoking , or try a over - the - counter snake oil instead ) and be at risk for a second heart attack . I sit down with them , and based on their personal needs talk about the risks vs benefits of the meds . Then I call them in a few days and follow up , making sure they 've made an appointment with their family doctor . Or , I do a medication reconciliation with an elderly woman who has too many medications with side effects , and work with her doctor to see if some can be stopped . - I answer people 's questions 24 hours a day with more accuracy and clarity than google . ( We are open extended hours ) For example- its 2 AM and someone comes in with a sick child : what medication do they use ? Should they go to the ER ? This saves the healthcare system ( or you , if you 're American ) money . - I give flu shots which saves the government money as they pay us less than doctors , and the patient time . I also give other vaccinations , such as hepatitis B , so if you 're going to Mexico you can be protected without the need for extra doctor visits . - I prescribe certain medications for minor conditions , again saving the healthcare system money and the patient time . - I can change some prescriptions with the patient 's ok , for example if a product is n't available or something is missing from the prescription . - I specialty make a lot of drugs , for example certain seizure medication for children is n't sold in liquid form- I will make this for you at 3AM when you realize you are completely out of doses for your kid . - I dispense and monitor methadone , helping former addicts come off narcotics and re - integrate back in society ( in partnership with their awesome nurses . ) - I deal with insurance agencies to try to get medications covered , sometimes contacting your doctor to see if an alternate drug would be acceptable . - I consult on the phone with doctors , nurses , homecare workers etc deciding what course of action would be in the best interest of the patient . - I use math calculations to be able to figure out the correct dose of things like Tylenol for infants too small to be listed on the box , again at 2 AM . Or help someone self - adjust their insulin . - I get annoyed when someone is yelling at me from across the counter wondering why their order is n't done yet , asking what the heck I do all day . ;) TL;DR : Pharmacist 's are drug therapy experts who can help you take charge of your health and decide if a certain medication is right for you .

Modern devices contain a lot of extra components that handle amplification of the signal , digital displays , and other additional features of the radio .

In this case the ' medium ' is a radio wave . What a radio will do is encode the ' information ' to be transmitted onto a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation . I 'll leave out the fancy mathematics but essentially all the components of a modern radio will combine the specific frequency of the carrier medium with the ' information ' ( a song for example ) . This is then fed into a radio antenna that transmits that combined electromagnetic signal which a radio will pick up if it 's tuned to the correct carrier frequency . There are 3 basic ways that you can encode the information you wish to transmit onto an electromagnetic wave . * * Amplitude modulation * * , * * Frequency modulation * * or * * phase shift modulation * * . There are more complicated variations of those but i 'll stick with AM and FM as they are the easiest to convey . AM will ' modulate ' the carrier frequency with the information by increasing or decreasing the amplitude , that is to say the maximum height the signal will be if you looked at it on oscilloscope . FM works by modulating the frequency instead which requires less power to transmit than AM and allows for more information to be encoded per channel than AM for reasons that get complicated . * * TL;DR * * AM is simple so a wire of sufficient length will pick up the frequency of a channel potentially transmitting information .

You have a pen that can draw anything in that space , and you have a rule book that creates all of the rules for that world . Let 's say that you really want to see a sword fight in your world , so you draw two swords . After you 're done drawing , you realize that they 're just floating there , so you create a rule to have them swing at each other . So these swords start swinging , but you see that they just pass through each other . They do n't stop and bounce off each other because your rulebook only says to swing , it says nothing about bouncing off of each other when they touch . So you have to create a rule that says that if the two swords touch , they have to stop their movement and bounce off each other . First you have to create a rule that determines what touching means . Then you create a rule about how to tell if the two things are touching . Then you create a rule about what to do when those two things touch . Not content with your clashing swords , you decide that you need create a much more elaborate fight . So you draw a couple of knights , some horses , a shield or two , and a fancy background . As you build more and more , you realize you have to create a lot more rules .

You realize that you do n't really care if the cloud you drew up in the sky bumps into a tree and bounces the right way , right ? It 's a waste of time to keep checking to make sure the cloud follows the rules about bouncing the right way , so you decide to take away the rule about clouds bouncing off objects . Now you do n't have to worry about tracking the clouds , and you can focus on drawing other things and making sure everything else is following the rules you wrote .

In your example ( the gun through the vest ) , it would take a lot of math to not only determine where your gun and vest were colliding , but also to calculate where the objects should be relative to each other . There is probably a hit box ( the geometric shape that is tracked for hit detection ) around the player and the gun , but it probably does n't include all of the details of the vest , because that intricate geometry would be hard to track .","100 % accurate collision detection is extremely processing power intensive work for a computer so much so that it 's not an option for real time video games . There would just be to many checks that would need to be made to see if things are colliding instead game so devs use extremely simplified collisions shapes ( like rectangles to approximate a human body ) that are rarely accurate to the object in question . Many objects in the game world just simply wo n't have collision detection enabled period to reserve processing power . In the case your talking about it 's likely that the clothing has no collision detection and the animations are likely mostly canned instead of procedural . Both would need to be true in order for the game to notice the clipping and to modify the character model to prevent it .

These patients require immediate surgery to stop the bleed in order to survive , or an excellent field medic that can locate and ligate the artery before the patient bleeds out . Technology is improving though , there now exists syringes filled with tiny sponges that contain clotting factors that swell up and help stop a bleeding artery even if you ca n't locate it . You just inject the sponges into the wound and it is often effective in controlling the bleeding until the patient can reach definitive care .","You have a ton of arteries . If you block one off , the blood will re - route via other paths . If you cut it open and leave it , it 'll continue to get blood flow , which will flow out on to the ground and you will die . Amputations are done in a controlled manner , clamping off important vessels as you go so blood gets re - routed .","Posters so far are incorrect . A amputation does not need to be surgical for you to not bleed out . After an amputation , surgical or other , Arteries and veins tend to pull back towards the heart . This pull back into the wound causes the end of the arteries to gets crushed and the blood is able to clot quickly in the artery and stop bleeding . If you get a large cut that rips open a large artery , but not completely it does not retract and the flow is unable to be stopped quickly and therefore you die . Its really about the bodies ability to stop blood flow through clotting or mechanical ways . This is why in war movies you will see the field medics reaching into wounds with metal clamps to try to clip off an artery before the jagged damage . That being said you can easily and often will die from an amputation , especially if the wound is not a clean edge . Also in war movies those shrapnel wounds that bleed out are damaging very large arteries ( common to see femoral ) , as you get further from the heart the arteries carry less blood , because there is less tissue to deliver to ( and less internal organs ) . having your hand or foot blown off therefore damages smaller arteries than a wound to your femoral artery ( groin area than wrapping around the back of your thigh ) or aorta / main aorta branches .

Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. If an artery is cut, the person can lose a lot of blood very quickly. This can be dangerous because the body needs a certain amount of blood to function properly. If the person loses too much blood, they may go into shock or their organs may not get enough oxygen, which can be deadly.\\n\\nSo, in summary, a person can survive an amputation if they receive proper medical treatment, but they may not survive if their artery is cut because they can lose too much blood."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"When you get a cut on your finger, it hurts, right?

Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Getting rid of Net Neutrality does NOT benefit the consumer . CGP Grey have made a 3½ minute video about it , that is vary easy to understand . URL_0","This question can not be answered because the premise is false . It does not improve competition in a way that benefits the consumer .","Lets say you watch pay for a subscription to stream movies on website A , but website A is lacking in the anime department .

Except ... how do people get to your site ? The internet . Under net neutrality , the internet provider * has * to treat websites the same ( load them all the same rate , etc . ) , so both website A and B load just as fast ( way oversimplifying , there is some nuance with back end servers and all that ) , so in theory , all the anime fans can say \" hey B is super great it has all the anime that I was missing with A ! \" This then would cause A to realize that B is taking customers from them because they do n't have anime , and A adds anime titles to compete for those customers back . Launches a big advertising campaign , the works . B obviously does n't want to fall behind , so it adds live streaming of * new * anime as it airs in Japan for diehard fans .

So what happens ? Big Internet says \" bummer ... you're on our ' so slow dial up would 've been a better choice but it 'll still load eventually ' speed if you do n't pay up . \" And Big Internet is n't a bad guy for doing this ! Yes , its totally exploiting their position of power , but literally * every * company would do this , simple economics .

They say \" it loads so slow ! \" or \" Who cares if its a live stream if I ca n't get it to open before next week ? \" and they abandon the site . A then gets all the traffic and , yay A will keep catering to these customers ! Right ? Wrong . Now that customers essentially do n't have a choice ( site that actually loads , vs one that 's slower than Verizon to adopt unlimited data ) , A has no incentive to improve its selection . They essentially become a monopoly which , like Big Internet , can do things that make sense economically , but are overall dick moves .

I do n't know much about the regulations in other countries , but here in The Netherlands bottled water is of a lower quality than tap water . Before water comes out of the faucet it 'll get ' cleaned ' . They remove a lot of particles in different ways . The water used for tap water can be from the surface , but can also be from deep in the ground . The water from deep in the ground needs less filtering , this is why bottled water is usually made from this water . The tap water here is way cheaper because if the government funds it . The tap water would be way more expensive than bottled water . If you would drink pure water , you would die because of what is called reverse osmosis .

Sometimes they do add trace ingredients ( minerals and such ) supposedly for taste , but in blind taste tests the vast majority of people ca n't tell the difference between bottled water and tap water so that 's a bit dubious in my eyes .

The EPA has a lot of tight regulations and often has dedicated individuals responsible for regular inspections and testing of tap water , whereas the FDA does n't really dedicate anyone specifically to bottled water . Ultimately , the difference between tap water and bottled water overall is fairly minimal , however bottled water quality is probably more uniform across the country than tap water . The tap water in some areas will be significantly better or worse ( or simply different depending on the method of treatment ) . Depending on where you live the tap water or the bottled water could end up being a little bit better - I grew up in Oregon and I always thought bottled water tasted far worse , but after traveling around ( especially up and down the East coast ) there are definitely areas where I 'd consider the tap water worse than bottled water . tl;dr : Speaking generally there 's no fundamental difference , and some bottled water is in fact just tap water .

So how did they figure out all the stuff he did ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["For most operating systems , deleting files actually does not remove them from the hard drive . When you delete the file , the first character of the file name is replaced with the \" ~ \" character . This hides the file from the directory structure . Much like erasing a building on a street map does not remove the building . More advanced removal involves writing a pattern of characters over the \" blank , \" area of the hard drive . Even this process is not a full proof method of deletion , because advanced low level recovery can read the slight differences in the layer of magnetic material of the platter ( think of it as a CD but magnetic like a tape . ) The second method is costly and often incomplete but can recover significant amounts of data . The last method is retrieving data from Off - site storage . Many programs provide cloud based storage . Occasionally people will think they have removed a file but there is a remotely stored copy .","there 's a few ways . 1 . wiping your hard drive does n't actually wipe the contents . for example , OS 's operate in a similar fashion to the dewey decimal system . the OS stores a table of pointers , that point to where the actual data resides . if you wipe this table , all the data is still there , but it can be freely overwritten at any time . 2 . if you actually over write the data stored . due to the propeties of magnetism and such , even if you overwrite a location , you can still guess the data that was there because of lingering magnetic fields .","None of these other answers seem to quite properly explain deleting data simply . Basically though , ALL computer data is fundamentally a combination of Ones and zeroes . Patters of these are programs , files , or everything else on a computer . Your PC 's operating system knows this , and marks out these patterns , giving them space . The thing is , the harddrive is a big place . once it gives them space , it has to remember where that space is , or else it has to search everything to find it again . So , it creates a table , and in that table it records where the start of those patterns are , as well as what they are , and how big they are ( ELI5 explanation , its not completely accurate , but close enough here ) . When you delete a file , all most operating systems do by default is delete its entry in the table . For an operating system , if the space is not in the table , it can be written on . As such , Deletes are significantly faster than installs . However , until that empty space is assigned to new files , the old ones will remain , and special programs can search for things that look like files and mark them as such , restoring them . Expanding on ( and shamelessly using ) sirbearus 's example . The Operating system is like the city layout manager . The table that says where everything is , is a lot like a map , and the files are buildings . When a new guy wants to build a building , he goes to the manager . The manager gives him a plot of land , and he builds his building . Later on , the building is scheduled for destruction . To save time and money , the city manager simply removes the building from the map . As such , the building still stands , but no map leads to it . Survey crews ( special programs ) can still search the areas of the map marked as empty , and can easily see if buildings are there , and completely intact . To save costs , they will remain that way until the manager decided a new building is to be built in the lot , which could be a very long time after it was freed up . To get around that , you can use special programs , which will bring in wrecking crews and actually destroy buildings . These things go to the file , and overwrite it with new data , permanently destroying at least some of it . Coincidences can mean it does not destroy all of it . The down side is , as expected , it takes a long time . Sometimes , they will run multiple times to really ensure random chance does not leave too much data intact , which means it could take a very long time . And , again , as other answers pointed out , Even if your manager erases the building on the map , there can still be records outside of the managers reach which prove it was there to begin with . Servers can easily record your Ip address ( unique identifier that can usually point directly to your house ) as well as when you arrived , what you requested , and lots of other information .

","human_answers":["Depends on house price vs rental potential as to how easily you can make money . We started by simply not selling our old house when we bought a new one . We maintained two mortgages instead and rented one property . We then slowly built up enough funds for further properties until we had five total . We have since scaled back to three but our own home is now entirely debt free . I would say that house rental is not as profitable as renting a flat / apartment . Our original house rental yielded virtually no profit . Flats on the other hand are fantastic . Also easier to maintain . Biggest profit though is in appreciation of property price - so choose your location carefully .","I own quite a few properties used solely for investment . First off , you make money by charging tenants ( renters ) for living in your house . Depending on the terms , the rent can cover utilities or the utilities can be payed by the tenant every month / week / fortnight .

If it 's an apartment , most management ( body corporate ) will limit the tenants you 're allowed to have to a certain number ; however , if it 's a house , it 's up to your discretion . To get started , first , of course , get a unit ( property ) under your name . Next , speak to a lawyer about drafting a tenancy agreement - this will legally bind your tenants to the rules you set out for them for renting . After that , list your property with an agent or online to find tenants . If you are renting the unit yourself and want to rent out a room ( or the entire unit ) then it 's called subletting . You 'll need to check with your landlord and look at your tenancy agreement to see if this is allowed . Tips : 1 ) If you own the unit but are still paying mortgage , try to make the amount you rent the property for equivalent or greater than your monthly payments to the bank , that way you 'll basically be buying the house for how much your down - payment was and possibly making profit . 2 ) It 's always easier if you 're in the country or area where you 're managing the properties . I move around quite a bit so I have a agent help me out when needed . 3 ) Do n't skimp on the legal fees for tenancy agreement contracts , a solid contract could save you a lot of time , effort , and money in the future . 4 ) Talk to your tenants before agreeing to let them rent .

For instance , Watson has been used for medical diagnoses due to its ability at linking queries and answers .","Both /u / Concise_Pirate and /u / Connor24601 are correct somewhat . Originally IBM wanted to see if they could build a machine that is able to understand unstructured data as a human would . In other words , understand the intricacies of language that simple parsing engines are unable to . The example normally given is : Fly over the boat with the red bow . To a human this is relatively easy to parse . It means a plane flying over a boat that has the bow of the ship coloured red . To a computer \" fly \" could mean house - fly . \" red bow \" could refer to a hair ribbon that the fly is wearing , or it could refer to a house - fly holding a bow and arrow . Once it could understand what the person meant , it was able to take action on that passage of text . In the original case , this was to find a question to an answer , then test if what it thought was right was correct ( it would test itself ) , and then buzz in on the quiz show .

Outside of that , two non - medical spin offs were Watson Discovery Advisor and Watson Engagement Advisor . WDA was similar to a search engine , except that it could make connections you would not normally get in a search engine , and show exact evidence to why it picked an exact answer . It also had a cool feature You could give it a question and answer , and it would try to find evidence to link both . Watson Engagement Advisor on the other hand was closer to Jeopardy . It was designed to understand questions people have who may not know what they are looking for . For example : Imagine your car is acting weird , you open the engine to find a red wire hanging off to the side . You do n't know what it does , and searching for \" Red wire \" is not only not going to give good results , but you would have 100 's of things to read through . Then if you go to a mechanic and tell them what you saw , they can normally tell you what 's wrong . That 's because not only have they been trained on the material , but they are also able to make the connection of your \" non - mechanic \" speak to their knowledge . This is what WEA did . It later got added a component to deal with conversation beyond simple question and answer . --- Now while these worked great , at the time they required a lot of resources and highly technical people to understand and train them . The other part to this was that there are a number of products that IBM were working on which fall under this \" cognitive \" grouping . For example understanding cooking , speech , pictures , emotion and tone . So there was a move to making Watson accessible on the cloud by anyone ( which is now on Bluemix ) .

There is a lot of pressure within US to give some of that \" Stolen power \" back to the States where it technically belongs .","The concept of federalism is that an issue is usually best handled by those closest to it . Power is decentralized into multiple smaller areas , ones that are made up primarily of those who care about and are affected by a particular issue , to be resolved by those same people . Virginians know more about issues that affect Virginians , and Californians know more about issues that affect Californians . Those groups retain their own authority to handle issues and policies for their own citizens . Only issues that a smaller level can not do on its own , such as national defense , are given to the larger level of government . The goal of this is to create not a one - size - fits - all way of doing everything , but many ways of doing things , specific to those groups of people who want things done their way .

{"question":"how can some people function normally while needing substantially less sleep than other people ? Like how can some people who get only 5 or 6 hours of sleep every night function at the same level as someone who gets 8 - 10 hours of sleep a night ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["This is something that is still debated . First , some people insist they only need 5 or 6 hours of sleep a night and then survive off sugar and coffee to stay awake . Very few people can actually do this healthily , but some can . Scientists have linked a gene to most of the people who survive on extremely little sleep , but it 's still unsure what exactly does . But ignoring extremes , its probably mostly a matter of efficiency . For example . Given the exact same lifestyle otherwise , some people need around 2000 calories a day while another needs 2500 for the same lifestyle . So that is a matter of how efficiently their body processes calories . The same can be true of sleep . Someone whose body falls into deeper sleep more quickly and who has fewer periods of wakefulness might need less sleep than someone whose body needs a while longer to achieve the same depth of sleep . It also could be their brain just more effectively using the sleep . Some may be caused by personal sleep habits and some genetics . It would be more strange if everyone needed identical amounts of sleep .","As is the simple answer for most questions pertaining to biology : genetics . Sleep has a number of hypothesized functions , but it is clearly intended as a restorative period for the body to recover from stress , injury , and exertion . Your tissues heal quicker . There is evidence that sleep literally cleans your brains of toxins accumulated during the day : URL_1 The reasons for why someone may need less sleep than someone else are myriad . Perhaps they produce * less * toxins while awake , and thus need less sleep to recover . Or perhaps they produce the same amount of toxins , but are simply * more efficient at clearing them out * . As it goes with genetics , there is likely no single \" right answer \" . Two people who both only need 4 hours of sleep per night may have very different genetic reasons for only needing 4 hours of sleep . One man , Dean Karnazes ( URL_0 ) has a rare genetic mutation that essentially gives him abnormally fast healing , so fast , in fact , that he can run and his body * recovers faster that it breaks down while running * . Life is full of these little quirks .","The long and short of it is mental discipline allows a sleep deprived person to perform better than a less disciplined tired person . They do not perform ' the same ' as a person who got good sleep , but they can minimize the problems the lack of sleep can cause so their performance suffers less than it could have if they were not disciplined . I sleep on average 4 to 5 hours a night for most of my adult life . When I was younger I would need 12 - 16 hours on the weekend in order to make up the sleep debt of doing that during the week . I 'm in my early 40 's now and I only need 8 hours of sleep on the weekends to feel refreshed with 4 - 6 hours typical during the week . I feel as tired I think as anyone else who slept only a few hours over several days so it 's not that I do n't need the sleep , it 's just that sometimes I ca n't , and by sometimes I mean most of the time . However , my ability to be productive even being so tired is a learned ability that took time to develop . So for me it has less to do with me not needing the sleep , because I do , and more to do with me being able to stay productive even dead on my feet , which is a learned skill and not a physical attribute . I am a bright person in general , and I can cruise control my way through most demanding situations so this helps a lot . When I am tired I am not thinking very clearly , but because things tend to come easy for me , it helps make up for this so that I 'm just average on very little sleep instead of a zombie . When I get really good sleep for a few days by comparison , I feel like life takes on a clarity I seldom see and it feels like I 'm finally awake and thinking clearly . IE normal , but I 'm abnormal so much , normal seems weird . There are some tricks to being productive when you 're tired . The first and foremost is strong mental stamina . You have to have enough self control to not drift or doze off while driving , when bored , when listening to a lecture or attending a meeting . You have to force yourself to concentrate , and catch yourself when you begin to drift and mentally slap yourself awake . This is probably the skill I have the most development in . I can sleep 4 hours a night for a week straight , yet read boring technical articles at my desk without falling asleep at work . I have different thought exercises I do to maintain focus and re - invigorate my mind . Sometimes I do allow myself a few minutes to day dream say during a break or lunch . This re - invigorates me for the next few hours . Ironically the less I sleep , the harder it is for me to sleep . I am tired , but wide awake , and falling asleep is difficult . However , the better rested I am , the easier it is to rest . So if I am not careful , I tend to get worse and worse , sleeping less and less , until I reach a crisis point where my performance degrades too far and I am exhausted yet still unable to sleep . And alternatively if I 'm on vacation or something , and allow myself to sleep as much as I want , I could literally sleep the day away as the more rested I become , the more drowsy and sleepy I am . I work in a demanding technical field and my ability to recognize and troubleshoot problems , and to communicate and reason in clear and articulate ways is important . I enjoy a frappacino every morning , but otherwise do not drink coffee or soda . I do n't use stimulants to wake up or stay alert as they would make me jittery which I do n't like . I tend to be awake at all hours of the night which has lead to some people wondering if I ever sleep since they see facebook and reddit comments from me all through the night and day . I am able to sleep soundly and stay asleep most of the time even if woken . But I have struggled to fall asleep most of my life . My ability to sleep and hold a sleep schedule is my biggest challenge in life and the one that has the greatest impact on my quality of life and happiness . It 's a problem I struggle with continuously . I do n't really drink other than a cider every so often , and I do n't do drugs . I 'm also not an energetic and hyper person .

Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["> why would someone destroy their lives for a gram or two Despite the strong neurochemical aspect of hard drugs , I would n't say they make someone addicted . Keep in mind that people who turn to strong drugs are usually in a difficult situation psychologically along with a low socio - economic status , few opportunities in their life and usually some troubled relationships . Addiction is a way to feel normal / better than usual in an incredibly quick amount of time . Once they come off the high , the same old shit is going on and they have no reason not to turn back . I know I 'll probably get downvoted by someone responding that ' not all poor people in shitty circumstances turn to drugs ' and that 's true but that does n't mean that people will magically turn okay as opposed to not having taken heroin . If you think about it , heroin is the ' superhighway to a destructive cycle ' . A lot of people think that if people did n't take drugs they would have been perfectly fine but most likely they would have manifested their problems in alcoholism , failing relationships , self harm , low self esteem , etc .. all of which are much slower to detect and usually do n't lead to death like heroin or meth do . In other words people do n't get ' ruined ' from heroin . They get ruined in slower ways which are much less noticeable .","Not to be a grammar nazi , but \" addicting \" is n't a word . The word you want is \" addictive . \" Coming from someone who used to spend $ 1200 a week on cocaine before I got away from it , I personally think it has to do with the fact that it makes one feel good . It changes one 's perceptions of the world , and , in the case of cocaine , causes the brain to release endorphin and actually causes mood elevation . Cocaine is very destructive to the soft tissues of the body and , over time , wears one 's nasal linings away , as well as the back of the soft palate . I was in a really bad way during that period of my life and it made me feel better . It helped me through the day , if you will . I know you asked about heroin and meth ( I have never used heroin and I like sleep too much to have done meth regularly ) , but I feel that most people who \" destroy their lives for a gram or two \" would probably say the same thing I did at the time : \" It makes life less shitty . \"","I agree a lot with /u / femmejean .

When scored , there are five subtests that correspond to the broad bands of intelligence based on CHC theory , and then the full scale IQ which is generally considered he best estimate of overall cognitive abilities and typically corresponds to spearman 's g , which is another intelligence theory where g is general intelligence .

You know when you wave your hand and your reflection also waves back at you in a mirror? That's because the surface of a mirror is very smooth and can reflect light really well. A white sheet of paper doesn't reflect light as well because its surface is not as smooth as a mirror and some colors of light get absorbed by the paper. So even though both reflect light, they do so differently."}

King Hubbert 's theory , is the point in time when the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum is reached , after which it is expected to enter terminal decline.[1 ] Peak oil theory is based on the observed rise , peak , fall , and depletion of aggregate production rate in oil fields over time . It is often confused with oil depletion ; however , peak oil is the point of maximum production , while depletion refers to a period of falling reserves and supply . Some observers , such as petroleum industry experts Kenneth S. Deffeyes and Matthew Simmons , predict negative global economy implications following a post - peak production decline and subsequent oil price increase because of the high dependence of most modern industrial transport , agricultural , and industrial systems on the low cost and high availability of oil.[2][3 ] Predictions vary greatly as to what exactly these negative effects would be . Oil production forecasts on which predictions of peak oil are based are often made within a range which includes optimistic ( higher production ) and pessimistic ( lower production ) scenarios . Optimistic[4 ] estimations of peak production forecast the global decline will begin after 2020 , and assume major investments in alternatives will occur before a crisis , without requiring major changes in the lifestyle of heavily oil - consuming nations . Pessimistic predictions of future oil production made after 2007 stated either that the peak had already occurred,[5][6][7][8 ] that oil production was on the cusp of the peak , or that it would occur shortly.[9][10 ] Hubbert 's original prediction that US peak oil would be in about 1970 seemed accurate for a time , as US average annual production peaked in 1970 at 9.6 million barrels per day.[11 ] However , the successful application of massive hydraulic fracturing to additional tight reservoirs caused US production to rebound , challenging the inevitability of post - peak decline for the US oil production.[12 ] In addition , Hubbert 's original predictions for world peak oil production proved premature.[4 ] In short , \" Peak Oil \" is the way of all non - renewable resources .

As workloads have increased , people have become more and more unhappy with Intel 's reluctance to push performance forwards , and their high prices .

What are threads here ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["In a CPU core , various types of calculations are actually done in physically different parts of the CPU . For example , integer arithmetic runs on a different part of the silicon than floating point ( decimal ) arithmetic . A CPU with multiple threads takes advantage of this by letting two programs run on a single CPU core at the same time as long as both programs do n't need to do the same type of instruction at the same time . This is why running two threads on a single core is n't usually a doubling of performance , because if both programs are trying to do integer arithmetic at the same time for example , they need to wait for each other . To make it more ELI5 , imagine a CPU core is a kitchen . A program that wants to run is a recipe that needs to be prepared . The various parts of a CPU core are the various areas of the kitchen . You only have 1 oven , 1 stove , 1 cutting board , etc . Adding additional cores is like adding an entire extra kitchen . Adding CPU threads to a core is like adding another chef to the kitchen . Sure , you can now cook multiple dishes in that kitchen now , but only as long as they do n't both want the oven at the same time . EDIT : As an anecdote , I used to do a lot of work with [ POV - Ray ] ( URL_0 ) , a free open - source 3D rendering app . In my 4 - core ( 8 thread ) i7 - 3770 , if I tell POV - Ray to only run with 4 threads so it only uses 1 thread in each core , then run a full 8 threads , it only gains about a 10 % speed increase because the extreme majority of POV - Ray 's work is floating point math , so it ca n't effectively take advantage of a multi - threaded CPU core .","I am left unsatisfied by all of the answers so far because I do n't think they get to the gist of the question , a la \" Why is an i7 a 4/8 machine which an i5 is a 4/4 ? \" Cores are * physical computing components * . Think of each core as an entire Pentium chip . Each core has all of the processing capabilities of that processor , including its cache memory . A multi - core chip takes a bunch of these processing units and puts them on one pice of silicon . In the case of today 's i5 and i7 processors , the cores get \" tied together \" with the highest level cache , which gets shared across all cores . On the other side of this cache is the interface to the rest of the world : the memory controller , the integrated graphics subsystem , and the PICe bus to other devices . A thread , on the other hand , is a * sequence * of instructions . As stated elsewhere , a multi - tasking computer has a LOT of threads running at the same time , and so the cores must * * switch * * between them , mostly depending upon how much time they need . However , this switch is expensive with regards to time because the * state * of one thread must be preserved so that when it gets reinstated , it can start up from where it left off . So , all of the register contents need to be saved along with a lot of invisible state variables . One way to increase performance , then , is to have multiple cores . For an i5 / i7 example without multi - threading , simplistically , your threads will run 4x as fast because switching happens 1/4 as often . ( This is not strictly true because some threads have higher priority , and some threads get * parked * onto a core and do n't get swapped out . ) And now for the meat : With just a few more resources ( silicon ) , we can duplicate a lot of the registers that need to get swapped out during a task switch . This means high - priority threads stop almost instantly and start instantly because the chip has more logical cores . Specifically , since the i5 does not support multithreading , its four physical cores support four simultaneous threads because when switching , it has to go through the save / restore cycle . But the i7 , which supports multithreading and has the additional resources turned on , * logically * looks like it has eight cores . Thus , all multi - threaded applications will run faster . ( Not all apps or * threads * can take advantage of multiple cores . ) This is why the 3.5GHz i5 - 6600 K gets a multi - thread CPU Mark of 7983 while the 3.4GHz i7 - 6700 gets 10,035 . But if you look at how fast a single thread on each is , you get 2148 and 2160 because the cores -- when minimizing switching -- are exactly the same . To * that * into context , Minecraft executes Java on a single core and should have the same performance at the same clock rate on both processors , everything else being equal . however , if you add the Optifine mod , Minecraft now screams because it can use multiple * logical * cores .","Cores are the hardware that does the actual processing , and threads are individual tasks that share time on a core .

","human_answers":["Abstraction is the idea that the user of some function or method does n't need to understand how the function works , the only thing they need to know is how to operate it ( i.e. the input and output ) . Abstraction is incredibly important for building complex programs or circuits because each level of abstraction brings an increased amount of overall complexity and there comes a certain point when it becomes unreasonable to necessitate that the user understand all the minute details of some function . Functions that have their inner workings hidden are often called \" black boxes . \" For all intents and purposes , the user just considers it to be this magic box where you put something in and you get something out . Sometimes it 's actually useful to understand on some level how the black box works because you can have two black boxes that do the same thing in different ways , and depending on the type of input you 're giving it , you might want to choose one over the other due to efficiency concerns .

If you put a few of these transistors together in certain configurations , you can create logical gates like AND , OR , NOR , XNOR , XAND , NAND etc ( Google these to see what they do ) . Using these gates , you can then build small circuits that output certain values given certain inputs . You can also make circuits that store information ( these are called flip flops ) . You can make circuits using these flip flops and logic to create circuits that can add two numbers , that can make RAM , you can make circuits that display an image on a screen , and all the other things that computers can do . Each level of abstraction : * the transistor ( which is itself an abstraction of quantum physics ) * The logic gate ( you do n't have to worry about how the transistors are configured to make the gate ) * The logic circuit ( you do n't have to worry about how the logic gates are configured ) * The functional circuit like an adder , a CPU , a GPU ( you * generally * do n't need to worry about exactly how all the individual components are configured to make the complex circuit ) Using abstraction , we are able to create programs and circuits and models of soaring complexity .","Say I make two classes with direct references to each other . This makes them tightly coupled , hindering them to be used individually elsewhere in the code . This often leads to the having to rewrite parts of code in other areas and making it a nightmare when you have to update the code a year later and only remember to update in once place . It also makes it difficult to test either class by itself , so debugging means effectively treating the two as a larger , more complex class . So the solution to this problem is to use abstraction to keep classes decoupled . You make an interface or abstract class that provides or describes some base functionality , and then anything implementing those can be used in operations throughout the code . This allows easier modification and testing , as you can add and remove classes without having to update existing code that operates on the abstracted level . And you can test the generic - handling code without relying on specific implementations of various classes . A basic example is sorting things . The sorting algorithm does n't care what the things actually are , just what the outcome is when you compare two of them to each other . So making that an interface with some compare function , you can now implement a sorting algorithm that works with anything that implements that interface . Or perhaps message parsing . If you know your messages all build off an abstract class telling what kind of message they are and how big they are , the parser can look at this abstract level to obtain the relevant data to pass the message on to the appropriate parsing function . Or even further , perhaps the abstract class also has virtual methods to parse data , so now a generic message handler can tell the message to parse , knowing that all implementations know how to do that .","Think of how you use a car .

Well , it turns out that it means * rotating * it ! The function e^(i·t ) , when t is a real number ( so that i·t is imaginary ) always produces a point on the unit circle . When t=0 , e^(i·t ) = 1 . But as t increases , e^(i·t ) rotates around the unit circle counterclockwise . When t = 2π , e^(i·t ) has gone all the way around and is back at 1 . [ Picture ] ( URL_5 ) .

For instance , Re(2 + 3i ) = 2 , and Im(2 + 3i ) = 3 . The real part and imaginary part functions are not ordinary arithmetic functions — they 're more like the absolute value function . But using these definitions , we can indeed define sine and cosine using ordinary arithmetic functions : [ Image ] ( URL_1 ) . A little fiddling will result in “ Euler 's formula ” : [ Image ] ( URL_2 ) And so we have an explicit definition of the sine and cosine in terms of familiar functions .

Another way is that your Operating System helps you .

This is much better randomness , as it ca n't be predicted by software how you type .

It is typically actually a pseudo - random number generator ( PRNG ) , which means that it ’s not _ truly _ random — just made to look as close to one as possible . PRNGs are based on algorithms very very few people are actually interested in , usually made more random by adding some type of confounding ‘ noise’—often things like whatever is happening on the computer at the time , which is generally unpredictable ahead of time . Think the mouse moving , or data packets moving back and forth the wifi . So as a very simplified illustration , you could imagine that an algorithm produces you the number 5 . At the same time the mouse happens to move 4 pixels . You add 5 + 4 , and then you apply another round of randomness on top of _ that _ . The final result would be very difficult to predict . It ’s also possible to have a _ true _ random number generator , but those will be based on more exotic technology like measuring radioactive decay .

{"question":"What is the difference between ' Climate Change ' and ' Climate Warming ' ? Is there even any ? If not why are n't we just using Climate warming since that seems to be more accurate ? Explain like I'm five.

The problem with the term global warming is that after the El Nino year in 1998 the earth went through ~10 years of no warming , perhaps slight cooling . All the science and predictions were that carbon emissions were driving the climate the warm , but this did n't happen and skeptics of the conventional wisdom pounced on it . So over time the term \" climate change \" became popularized to describe any change in climate caused by human interaction with the earth . If you are referring to human impacts that cause warming you can still be accurate and use the term global warming , but in most conversations the term climate change is more accurate because most conversations discuss more than just the warming of the earth .","You need a flair . Actually Climate Change is more accurate . Overall the effect is warming . But in some regions there will be more snow . Warm air carries more moisture . So when it gets cold it will dump more snow . The ice fields will actually get thicker some places . Climate change deniers would seize on this . So it is best to say Climate Change . Farmers in Iowa do not want climate change . So they do not want to hear the words . But if you ask them if they want to know about changing weather patterns they are all ears . It is a question of semantics . They will deny climate change .

The push of warmer air into colder climates forces pockets of cold air in the [ Polar Vortex ] ( URL_0 ) to move into more temperate zones , which can create prolonged periods of very cold temperatures in places where it 's not likely to be so cold .

By turning our telescopes to the parts of space that are both empty and very very VERY far away we can then \" listen \" to electromagnetic waves ( like static on your TV ) . The big bang itself created a kind of \" cosmic background radiation \" which is a fancy way of saying that it 's static exists everywhere . We can then make a guess at the age by knowing how far that point we are listening is away from us and by how fast light can travel . This is not a perfect system but it is mathematically correct ( hence why its 13.7 billion years instead of an exact number like 13,726,432 years . We can only be accurate to within 0.05 billion years . ) Thus we look for areas that are the furthest away that we can hear the cosmic background radiation . Because that radiation from that area of space still has to travel to us we can guess its age . As an interesting point this holds true when looking at planets . Whenever you look at something you are actually viewing it in the past because light , again , has a travel time . Thus whenever a scientist finds a new planet and says something like \" It is 40 light years away from us . \" what this means is that we are viewing the planet as it was 40 years ago because it took light 40 years to travel from that planet to our eyes . Because of this any alien looking at earth from , say , 77 light years away , would be watching WWII , and an alien looking at earth from about 65.5 million light years away would be watching a meteor smashing into a planet full of dinosaurs .","We know that the universe is expanding and a certain rate and we can tell which direction it is expanded towards .

So we now we know the origin of the universe , along with the speed of the universe and the ' end ' of the universe we can easily calculate a time that it 's been moving and thus we get an age . Some other notes that are just some decent background : How do you get something from nothing ?

Nothing really changed . HOWEVER we know that 1 in 100 million times or so we created an electron without a positron . We are still looking into why this is . The Big Bang also fits into many of the formulas and theories we have created to explain the universe . So that 's good evidence that it happened . Finally the way science works is by testing the hypothesis and trying to prove it to not be possible . Can we prove that a tree makes a sound when no one is around ? Well I suppose not , but we can create formulas for the generation of a sound wave and learn that sound is due to air molecules vibrating . From there we try to make a tree fall without vibrating molecules and essentially find we ca n't do it unless we 're in a vacuum ( but we already know sound ca n't pass through without a medium ) .

Holocaust deniers believe that the number of deaths in the Holocaust is much smaller than what people say , and that they were caused by typhus , hunger and other health problems in the camps . By the end of the war Germany was very low on supplies , so the conditions in the camp deteriorated . Sometimes they like to point to the fact that many European countries have laws against Holocaust denial . They say that if it were really so self - evident that the Holocaust happened as described then it would n't be necessary to arrest people for questioning it . Usually the motive for fabricating the Holocaust has to do with the creation of Israel . The Holocaust created sympathy for the Jews , and made antisemitism very unpopular .","There 's a quote that stuck strongly with me : \" The people who claim that the holocaust did n't happen are usually the same people that wish that it did . \" If you 're unashamedly an anti - semite , you would n't want to be reminded that anti - semitism was what caused the death of millions . So , in an ends - justify - means manner , the holocaust needs to not have happened in order to not invalidate their racism .","There seem to be different reasons for it between Europe and America . In Europe it 's often people who do n't want to see Hitler painted in a bad light ; who are often Neo Nazis themselves who believe Hitlers envisioned globalist conspiracy and agree with his ideas about strong government and racial supremacy , but who may not necessarily condone the murder of entire populations . And so they consider the accusations of genocide as slander of their hero by the very same enemy he tried to fight : bankers , capitalists , globalists , Jews . Since this is considered to already come dangerously close to spreading Nazi ideology ( and since that ideology was in all likelihood specifically designed to succesfully appeal to the paranoid underbellies of lots of angry people , and thus spreads very easily ) , it has been made a punishable offense to deny the Holocaust in public , yes . And rightly so IMO . In the US though there seems to be something else going on . Aside from the fact that people have this weirdly personal , moral stake in whether or not a genocide happened in a different country over 70 years ago , people seem to often have a somewhat skewed view of what actually went down . And a lot of the scepticism stems from this view not being entirely accurate . No , people were n't being shoved into gas chambers and exterminated by the millions . It just did n't happen that way . From what we have found in the camps ' facilities they would have been going about it very inefficiently . Moreover , the envisioned gain of not having these people in the gene pool ca n't possibly have weighed against the logistics and resources such an operation would require . Nobody would organize such a thing for that sole purpose , however much they thought other races and disabled people were making their population weak . There are so many cheaper and more efficient ways they could have achieved that goal . The truth is a * little * bit more nuanced . Thing is , when they got into power , the Nazis started using political prisoners for forced heavy labor . Working conditions were deplorable . I remember a story about some railroad that had to be built under dangerous circumstances which took the life of about 20.000 prisoners , all previously rounded up because they were communists . That is * efficient * . You get work done that is potentially dangerous or unhealthy , and the people who die doing it were n't wanted in the first place . This is what makes the way the Nazis treated populations such a gruesome memory . The cold , ruthless , calculating way in which they decided each demographics ' worth for society and what to do with them . Jews ( among others ) were no longer welcome in that society . Step by step , they were being exceedingly excluded from interacting with it until eventually they were herded into ghettos and left there to rot . Conditions were , again , extremely deplorable and many hundreds of thousands died there from disease and starvation . When war broke out , many people and resources had to be comitted to fighting it . One thing an army needs most dearly besides soldiers , is stuff . Ammunition , things like that . And people who make that for them by the millions . Luckily they had camps full of prisoners with nothing else to do . What 's more , they had ghetto 's full of Jews , Roma , gays , handicapped . Most of all they had a bunch of new territory with even more people ready to be plucked out of the gene pool . So they sent everyone to labour camps . To make bullets for them . Batteries . Clothes , soap , other things . And to be subjected to experiments for medical and military purposes . Now you had to be * able * to labour of course . Anyone who was too weak , too sick , too old or too young was , yes , sent to the gas chambers . They had no further use to the regime . And they killed a shit ton of people this way . The rest was living under , again , deplorable circumstances . Many died from disease and starvation . As the war started going badly for Germany , and started creeping towards a potential German defeat , institutions involved with the deportations tried to destroy all evidence of what had been going on . This included the concentration camps and anyone in it . So even more people were killed and dumped into mass graves . By the end of the war the death toll had risen into the millions .

The original French versions ( at least the early ones , before the writer Goscinny died ) were known for their sophisticated parody , satire , wit and -- a particular nightmare for translators -- an endless stream of puns . Puns can almost never be translated , and so Bell and Hockridge had to write their own puns of the same quality of the French originals * and * ( because these were comics ) which also fitted in with the pictures and the speech bubbles .

It is based on the idea that, in a deck of cards, there are more face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) than small cards (2 through 6). Since face cards are worth 10 points and small cards are worth less, a player who knows that there are more small cards left in the deck may be more likely to win the hand.\\n\\nNow, casinos don't like players to use card counting because it gives the player an advantage over the house. So, they have a few ways to try and catch people who are doing it. One way is to watch how the player bets. If the player suddenly starts betting a lot of money when the deck is favorable, that might be a sign that the player is counting cards. Casinos might also use surveillance cameras to watch players and see if they are doing anything unusual, like keeping track of the cards that have been played.

{"question":"Why does sound changes pitch when moving away ? Just noticed in car 's engine that drove really fast that it 's pitch lowers even though it 's constant . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Doppler effect . Think of sound as being invisible waves emitting from the source . Imagine an engine sitting still 100 yards away . It emits 1 wave per second . This is the \" normal \" sound . When the engine is traveling towards you , it is still emitting 1 wave per second , but between each emitted wave it is getting closer to you , so you end up getting hit by 1 wave every 0.8 seconds . This makes the pitch of the sounds higher in our ears . But as soon as the engine passes you , the engine is still emitting 1 wave per second , but between each wave it 's getting further from you , so each wave hits you every 1.2 seconds . This makes the pitch of the sound lower in our ears .","Pitch is just another word for the frequency of the sound . Frequency is simply how frequently something occurs . In the case of sound , it 's how many sound waves reach your ear in a given period of time . At around 261 waves per second is the musical note Middle C. So if you had an instrument playing middle C you would be detecting those 261 waves every second . Now what happens if you start to move that instrument away from you at high speeds ? Well the instrument is still releasing 261 waves per second , but because the distance between the instrument and your ear is increasing the instrument is just a bit further away between each of the waves than it was from the one before . Because it 's further away it takes slightly longer for that wave to hit your ear , and as such you are n't getting all 261 waves every second anymore . So things moving away from you will have an apparent lower pitch than things stationary , or things moving towards you .","The Doppler effect ( red or blue - shifting with light ) is when when a moving object is emmiting a wave , the waves do not change their speed depending on what side they were emmitted from , and so are squished together on one side , and spread appart on the other .

If you are only using 1 core , you can be sure that A will happen before B , so the result of A is ready when you need it for B , and B 's result will be ready when you need it for C and D. If using multiple cores , you ca n't be sure that A will happen before B , but since B needs A to already be done , it will lock up the application until A is done and calculations on B begin . If one of the other cores is then already started on C , while the result of B still ai n't done , the application will lock up again until B is done ... and so forth . There are ways around a lot of this of course , but programming for true multi - core support is a lot more work then single - core support , like a massive amount of more work . A lot of multi - core games are n't even true multi - core . They are made like a single - core application would , where some parts that are n't time - sensitive are then off - loaded to the other cores . ie In an FPS game , the gfx / game engine and positition / aiming / view system could be running on one core , while the UI updates ( health , ammo and the like ) are then offloaded to another core , because a player wo n't notice if the UI is 0.03sec too late with updating your ammo count .

The following steps required the intermediate results from the previous steps . In computer programs you often have the same situation . You need to prepare an intermediate result first , before you can use the result to perform the next step . So if one step depends on the result of a previous step they must , for logical reasons , happen one after another ( sequentially ) . They can not be parallelized . In order to run tasks parallel to each other , the tasks have to be independent of each other . In a game there simply may not be enough independent tasks to keep all cores of a CPU busy .

The reason is that the water at the high end of the pipe has more gravitational * potential energy * than the water at the low end . How fast that water flows depends on the * difference * between the height of the two ends . It does n't matter whether you lowered the low end or raised the high end to produce that difference .

The actions of drugs are directly related to their affinity for particular receptors ( strong , moderate , weak ) and their binding type ( agonist / activator vs antagonist / deactivator , in basic terms ... The following may not be entirely accurate , and shortcuts in language will be used to more easily express the idea . Still a good overview though ! ) Hallucinogens , for example , mostly operate on 5HT , or serotonin receptors.(DA = dopamine , NE = norepinephrine , 5HT = serotonin , GABA = gamma aminobutyric acid , etc ... DAT= dopamine transporter of the synapse , NET = NE transporter of the synapse , etc ... ) There are many serotonin receptors in the gut , which is one reason why hallucinogenic substances can cause transient nausea , for a specific example . The 5HT subtype , 5HT-1A is most closely related the the \" psychedelic \" experience often described , and has a high density in the hippocampus ( related to memory , ) the amygdala ( emotional response and emotional memory , ) and the prefrontal cortex ( decision making , thought processes , etc . ) You can see , then , why a \" trip \" acts like a \" trip \" on a basic level . The actions of drugs is MUCH LESS about \" more dopamine here , less dopamine there , \" than it is , \" this drug tends to cause activation of this particular circuit which leads to this more complex behaviour with x many iterations and variations , and suppresses circuits here which reduces xyz behaviour . \" Confused yet ?

GABARs , or GABA receptors , have MANY separate sites for drugs or other molecules to bind to . The benzodiazepine site is one of them . When bound , it tends to sensitize the GABAR to GABA , the neurotransmitter , which leads to a depressive action in MANY areas or circuits of the brain . GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain . Benzos are highly specific . This inhibitory action prevents or reduces neuron activity and \" firing \" of electrical signals . This is why memory does n't quite work , you do nt have all gears engaged , etc ... Not all your neurons are firing ! Alcohol , or ethanol , its a very peculiar molecule . It permeates nearly all membranes , and equally diffuse throughout cells ( including neurons ) in the body .

It also operates on GABARs , and 5HTr 's , and glycine receptors , and NMDA and AMPA receptors ( sometimes associated with learning , tolerance to drugs , dissociation , anesthesia ... ) and quite literally almost anything we have knowledge of in neuroscience . It 's also destructive and damaging to cells in any quantity to some degree . Compare the following , which are all similar to dopamine , and bind to DARs in some form or another , as well as NE . receptors . The molecular and atomic nuances of drugs are extremely important in determining their effects : all receptors are slightly different , and subtypes are variant as well .

The proof is in the molecular structures and our hardware , which has many many subtypes and main types of receptors ! EDIT : This blew up kind of large . I meant 5HT-2A , guys . I mistyped one number . My bad lol EDIT : Lots of people are asking about cannabis , more info here I guess : URL_1","* * Here 's a real ELI5 :* * First that s not true . Some recreational drugs act on cannabinoids ( uh , weed ) , enkephalin s ( heroin , oxy , vicodin ) , or glutamate ( PCP , ketamine , cough syrup ) as well . second , you have to look at the receptors in the brain . That 's where the magic is . Receptors are the buttons which neurotransmitters push . For serotonin alone , we have something like 20 different buttons that all do different things . Some buttons make you hallucinate , some make you love everything on the face of the earth , and some will make you vomit and shit your pants . This is all from the same neurotransmitter . Different drugs that all act on serotonin press these buttons differently . LSD and molly are both serotonin drugs , but they feel way different because they push different buttons , and on different circuits . But you 're right , all recreational drug circuits lead back to dopamine . It just so happens that our pleasure and habit circuit seem to be one and the same , so take something pleasurable enough and it will turn into a habit . That 's recreation . Take it too many times and it will become addiction . TLDR Every drug pushes different buttons .","Think of your brain as a book , and neurotransmitters as letters or words . Although there are only a few letters , they can be put together in different ways to spell different words , which make sentences , etc . Sometimes altering a letter produces little change in meaning , sometimes it produces a massive change . Where this change occurs matters too ; if it happens in the table of contents , it can reference chapters that are n't really there , or it could change how the story is interpreted completely . The neurotransmitters can be thought of as the letters , neural circuits as the words / sentences , and the different lobes and areas of the brain as the different chapters . An increase of dopamine in the orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia will have 2 different effects , just like the word change in the example . As easy as it is , neurotransmitter functions ca n't be reduced to facilitating pleasure any more than you could say that the letter \" e \" is only used to spell nouns . It 's also noteworthy that reuptake inhibition is only a part of most drugs pharmacology , so there may be more upstream effects that have not been studied as thoroughly . Some drugs also mimic neurotransmitters , which further complicates things , and some even have no apparent effect on neurotransmitters at all !

{"question":"Why is the 2nd amendment , the right of the people to bear arms , so disputed as to the framers ' intentions , but other amendments seem clear ? Why is it written so confusingly so that there are such polar opposite interpretations ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["~~First of all , \" right to bear arms \" is just taking a clause of the sentence , it fully reads \" A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . \" So there 's then the idea of there being a ' well regulated militia ' a lot of gun owners are not members of a well regulated militia and are just gun owners.~~ /u / kkrazychic pointed why this was wrong ! Read what they had to say Secondly , it says \" the right of people to keep and bear Arms \" Depsite what the NRA and other ' gun advocacy groups ' say , most people who want to regulate guns would rather regulate specific aspects of guns ( such as not allowing huge magazines , background checks for those who want to buy certain guns , etc ) instead of not allowing any guns ever . Well why would those from ' gun advocacy groups ' lie about what others want ? Well one it is a very emotional political issue so saying that you support guns is similar to saying your Christian - it gets you easy votes . ( Note , I 'm not saying republican / democrats because democrats do this too . ) there is also a huge gun market , in the billions , and the idea that \" Obama is going to take your guns ! ! \" actually increased sales of guns , ammunition , and accessories . Third is the \" being necessary to the security of a Free State \" clause . This can take two paths : one would be back in the days when this was written , we did n't have a huge military like we do today . Today , if a foreign nation tried to take part of New York , we 'd have police and national guard there in minutes . Back in the day you 'd be expected to help protect your town . The second path this argument takes is \" what happens when we need to take our country back if a tyrannical leader gains control ? \" You ever hear the phrase \" it 's like taking a knife to a gun fight ? \" Well , you 'd be taking a gun to a drone fight . Even if ' the resistance ' had an unlimited supply of guns , ammunition , and other supplies , the US military is stronger and has way better supplies , planes , training , etc etc where even if ' the resistance ' could flip some supplies , it would n't matter . We could n't overthrow our government through force . Finally , the idea that there the second amendment is the only one that is interpreted differently by various groups is just wrong . The Supreme Court will hear cases pertaining to nearly all other amendments to the constitution ( specifically the 1st ) E : y' all gon na point out what 's wrong or just downvote ? E : thanks for the actual answers , going to try to amend my comment as it goes","First , other amendments ( such as the 1st and 4th ) are also pretty hotly contested ; but that s for another time . The general reason that it is so hotly contested is because , what is written was written over 200 years ago and , frankly , times were much simpler . The category of \" arms \" was significantly more narrow than it is today . So what constitutional lawyers have to do is attempt to interpret the ' spirit ' of the constitution which has many different readings ... lets take a look The second amendment is as follows : A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . As far as legal framework is concerned this is relatively small , with no exceptions or loopholes ... So the easiest interpretation is to , well take it at face value . That is to say , the government shall not infringe upon any citizen 's right to keep arms . If we accept the above interpretation , then it is easy to argue what defines \" arms \" ... It certainly includes rifles and pistols and the like ; but what about artillery ? DEBATE ! Anyways , a lot of people do n't accept the above interpretation . Instead , they like to focus on the first two pieces \" A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State \" . According to this interpretation , the right to bear arms is not a fundamental right to the individual , but to the people . Under this interpretation , many argue that the National guard is well in fact a \" well regulated Militia \" . And then there is the entire subsection of the population , who well ... don't care much for \" some 200 year old piece of paper \" and certainly are not fans of the Second Amendment in any right . So there is that debate as well , the debate around \" it was a law for a different people in a different time \" And if all of this is n't enough , there is all of the debate around the spirit of the law ; how this amendment interacts with the States ' ability to regulate and manage firearms , how different States ' laws may conflict and what role the government plays amongst these differences .","> Why is it written so confusingly You 'd have to ask the Founders :P FWIW , this is n't uncommon- a lot of the Constitution is written pretty vaguely , and required the courts to interpret it . But for starters - If they had wanted to , they could 've just copied the 1st amendment . They did n't , although it 's hard to say why . The first amendment just says \" citizens have free speech \" . The second has a \" because a , then b \" . Worse , it did n't bother defining these things . And even worse than the , the Supreme Court has basically been dancing around deciding it , because it 's a mess . ( until recently with the Heller decision in 2008 ) > \" army \" is the federal government and \" a militia \" is individual citizens ( whom the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed ) . The context here is that it was supposed to be set up as a states vs federal government ( pretty common in most of the set up of the government ) . They knew that the ( federal)government was going to need an army at some point , for various things . ( At first , they tinkered with the idea that it would have to raise the army for specific reasons , but that 's pretty impractical ) The guy who controls the army basically defacto controls the country . The idea was to counter balance this , the states would have militias ( basically a mini state army ) . The common interpretation until pretty recently was that the idea behind it was that they wanted to make sure the federal government could n't make it illegal to have a milita / guns . It was never really intended to be a every citizen could own a gun . > line break The other problem is technology . If the right to own guns is based on a \" militia \" , how does that apply to modern guns ? Do hand guns count ? Do rockets ? What about extended clips ? Does it apply to only stuff you 'd use in war ? Does that mean you can restrict gun ownership if it 's for self defense , but not militias ? etc the founders did n't really deal with this , because in a sense a lot of those were inconceivable at the time . It also runs into some other modern issues- women are commonly exempt from militias- does that mean they do n't have the right ? ( in a sense the 14th amendment patches this up unintentionally ) . What about recently released felons ? > clarified in the Federalist Papers # 46 that the \" army \" is the federal government and \" a militia \" is individual citizens ( whom the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed ) . He clearly stated that the purpose of such a militia is to counter the federal government . You have to be careful here about picking and choosing . For a lot of things , there were several versions / driving ideas ( as well as multiple Founders who did * not * agree on many things ) . For example , one version of the amendment ( written by Madison ) read as \" The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed ; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person \" If it 's just the right to bear arms , you would n't need that ending bit . > line break There 's also the issue of if it 's a federal or state law . The 2nd amendment , generally speaking , only applies to * federal laws * . After Miller , the SC ruled that it did n't apply to state / local laws . This is a huge deal , since many gun laws are at the state level , not federal . Again , the 14th amendment patched this up > line break There 's also \" common sense \" exceptions . To use a less controversial example , the first amendment has restrictions- you ca n't go around yelling \" fire \" in a theatre is the popular example . We 've acknowledged that the government can supress individual rights if it satisfies what 's called \" strict scrutiny \" : Basically , the government has to show it has a compelling interest , and that the rule is as narrow as possible ( in practice , this is far far stricter than it sounds in plain English . It 's almost impossible to satisfy ) . Indeed , coming back to the 2nd amendment , Justice Scalia ( a conservative ) noted that the Heller decision does n't mean that certain restrictions were n't allowed . Hand guns had to be allowed , but they left the door open for certain types of guns . Also , as part of Heller , the SC explicitly said that the 2nd amendment protects the right to bear arms for self defense , even though it does n't mention it . This is a * huge * deal , because self defense is way broader . * tldr * : It 's confusing because it was written confusingly ( ie , like shit ) . It does n't take very much to entirely switch the entire meaning one way or the other , depending on the emphasis . It 's also extremely short , so there is n't much context to draw on . In addition , the early SC ( which did a * huge * amount of work clarifying tons of parts of the Constitution ) did n't weigh in like it did for many other parts to clarify . edit : I should mention that in addition , the court case Miller(which came in 1939 and was basically untouched until Heller ) upheld the more restrictive view for a long time . When Heller came ( in 2008 ) , this was a very new idea , legally speaking .

{"question":"Why do drugs such as marijuana and cocaine induce paranoia to some degree ? With all the effects of dopamine and serotonin , I 'm wondering what is going on psychologically to cause the feeling of paranoia ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Actually , marijuana is not a drug itself . Marijuana is a plant that harbors a range of chemicals we call cannabinoids . We have identified more than 85 different cannabinoids . Marijuana may either induce or alleviate anxiety . Your brain already has cannabinoid - like compounds that it uses all the time . When marijuana is ingested , new mixes of cannabinoids are introduced and they can bind to differing receptor cells . Long story short , the anxiety - response of the brain is based on the initial biochemical conditions of the brain : > Our naturally occurring cannabinoids , anandamide ( AEA ) and 2 - arachidonoylglycerol ( 2 - AG ) have effects much like 9 - tetrahydorcanabinol ( THC ) . Cannabinoids may cause increased or decreased anxiety levels . Anyone who has experienced feeling \" paranoid \" while smoking marijuana has felt the effect of increased anxiety , while others report feeling \" mellow . \" These disparate effects are also produced by our naturally occurring cannabinoids . AEA and 2 - AG have been called \" promiscuous \" molecules , as they bind to CB receptors , but also bind to other types of receptors ; locking - on to different receptors leads to different effects . In general , CB receptors mediate the \" calming effect \" of THC - like molecules . In contrast , anxiety increases when cannabinoids bind to other receptors . One example is a receptor called TRPV1 . When either THC or naturally occurring AEA/2 - AG bind to TRPV1 , anxiety symptoms increase . These different effects of cannabinoids on the brain have complicated the study of marijuana and are responsible for the different effects from one person to another . > It has also been shown that our internal cannabinoids have different effects in different parts of the brain . In some areas of the brain , such as the periaqueductal gray matter , stimulating CB receptors leads to increased anxiety and depression .

There was a study a while back in which people who were told a drug could induce paranoia or people who came into the study with such a preconceived notion were much more likely to experience paranoia as a result when all they were given was aspirin . I do n't know about other drugs but when it comes to Marijuana there simply is n't evidence that paranoia is an actual side effect of the drug itself and not an emergent phenomena from cultural factors as many of us believe .

You can never get back the same amount of energy you put in and still have the car move forward . What you can do is charge the battery a bit when you * want * to slow down . Electric cars can do that , but it can not ever be enough to actually recharge the battery entirely . You just get a little bit of energy back .","One of the fundamental laws of the universe is that you can never get more energy back than what you put into something . The total amount of the energy in the universe is constant -- you ca n't make energy from nothing ! Another important factor is that no machine we can make is going to be 100 % efficient . This means that some of the energy we put into a system is going to get \" wasted \" , meaning that it becomes a form of energy that does n't do the kind of work we want it to . This is usually heat in a system such as an engine . In electronics , for example , some of the electricity traveling through a wire turns into heat and heats up the wire , meaning you will always lose some energy along the trip . Let 's look at this in terms of an electric car . I do n't know much about the details of how an electric car engine works , but you can imagine there are lots of places where the electrical or mechanical energy gets turned into waste heat -- think of electric wires heating up , or the friction of a drive shaft on its bearings heating them both up and taking some of the rotational energy away . Therefore , the energy that is put out by turning the wheels is always a little bit less than the energy you \" pull out \" of the battery . So , in order to charge the battery , what would you have to do ? You 'd have to have * * extra * * energy in the wheels compared to the energy you put into the engine , which is impossible because of the first part up above -- you ca n't make energy out of nothing ! You could conceivably hook up a system so that half of the energy going to the wheels goes to recharge the battery , but that 's kind of silly , since you would then need to pump out twice as much energy out of the battery to make the wheels spin at the same rate -- so it works out to be the same . What about charging with solar panels ? Well , now you 've added another source of energy -- the sun ! We 're no longer just powering the car off the energy stored in the battery ; we 're also using the gigantic fusion explosion happening constantly 93 million miles over our heads ! Clearly , there 's enough energy there . The problem is converting it to electricity fast enough and efficiently enough to power the wheels or recharge the battery in any sort of useful way . I do n't know the mathematical details , but somebody on reddit recently did the math and I believe it would take a couple of days to charge the battery of a Tesla with the most efficient solar panels we have if they covered the car . You then have to take into account that solar panels are heavy , and they might make the car less efficient to move in general .","This is a perpetual motion machine . They are impossible as they violate the second law of thermodynamics , in that you can not get out more energy than is put in .

A car engine can only generate a useful amount of power when it 's spinning in a quite narrow range of speeds . In order for that narrow range of engine speeds to translate to a high range of road speeds ( standstill to full flat out speed ) , then the car needs to have several gears which can be switched through . The way to think of these is the same as a normal pedal bike . You have low gears which are easy to turn the pedals , good for climbing hills , no good for high speeds .

You can control this by simply letting go of the accelerator ( as you would in a manual car ) and the car will shift up if you 're at the right speed . * * Manual :* * Your gear is n't engaged ( did n't completely remove your clutch ) and so it 's somewhat in a neutral position .

We 'll , you 're at the top of your engine speed and you want to keep accelerating , right ? So we go to 2nd gear . Let 's presume it 's 2:1 . But you 're still going 25 mph , so the engine has to lose speed ( the difference has got to go somewhere and you 're not going to accelerate instantly to top engine speed of 2nd gear ) , about 1/3 of it 's rpm , so to go 25 mph in 2nd gear which is 2:1 , your engine only has to rotate at 3,333 rpm . Now you have 1,667 rpm to accelerate in 2nd gear up to whatever speed before you repeat the process with the next gear , and the next , until you achieve effectively 1:1 at top gear .

If you have AWD , you have 3 differentials , because you have to split transmission output between front and back , and then again each to left and right . Your diff is likely somewhere near 2.1:1 , a sports car can be closer to 5:1 . The shock is because that drop is n't some perfect action . The car 's computer is going to cut your throttle , but if you have an automatic , the engine and transmission are connected hydraulically . The two components are allowed to slip past each other , and viscosity of the oil , the now slower rotating input shaft is going to \" drag \" the engine down to matching speed . Then you apply throttle and the engine \" drags \" the transmission up to speed . A manual transmission has a clutch , these are two friction plates made of material similar to your brake pads and rotors . When engaged , the engine and transmission are physically linked . That means if the wheels are n't rotating , neither is the engine , and you stall ! The trick is to ease the clutch together so the plates are allowed to slip until the car is moving with the engine for a complete connection . There is something called overdrive , and this is a ratio that is greater than 1:1 , typically 1:1.15 . The goal is to lower engine rpm for fuel economy without sacrificing the power needed to maintain highway speeds . It 's even a thing at all because people want cars that can accelerate , so you need gas hungry monsters and large gear ratios , but people also want fuel economy , which you can do with smaller engines and slower acceleration , or by running your gas hog real slow . You need a transmission because engines are terrible at producing torque , which is force - the same force you use to push a heavy box across a room , but used to rotate an axis , it gets it 's own name . They especially suck at it at low rpm . You need force to move a heavy ass car , and your engine sucks at it , so the transmission multiplies torque . Electric motors produce 100 % of their torque even at 0 rpm , and they can run in reverse , which is why they do n't have transmissions . Horsepower is a measure of work . So are Watts . In fact , you can convert between them . Anyway , work is best described as , \" If you want to cross a room in half the time , you need to perform twice the work . \" A strong man can march across a room dragging a boat anchor , and that 's like torque , but that strength he has does n't get him there any faster than if he would move his ass ... Torque can be converted into horsepower through a transmission , but that would require lots of gears . Quickly you 'll have more gears in a big heavy transmission , spending more time shifting than accelerating , than is practical . That 's why diesel engines are n't used in racing outside of diesel racing categories . Speed favors work , not torque ."],"chatgpt_answers":["When you accelerate your car, you are asking the engine to work harder to move the car.

{"question":"Why did Europe develop faster then the rest of the world ? What are the factors that kept Africa , the Middle East or the Americas from this kind of development ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["This is explored in detail in Jared Diamond 's book * Guns , Germs , and Steel . * Eurasia generally was blessed with several fortunate contingencies : Geographical : Eurasia has an extremely long expanse along latitudes favorable for agriculture . North America , South America , and Africa have much more constrained geography . Put simply , many aspects of culture and technology are more portable across latitudes than they are along north - south longitude . Wherever you go around the globe , similar latitudes will have similar day length and reasonably comparable temperatures . North - south travel cuts a swath across much more dramatic climate conditions . This had multiple effects : 1 . A greater variety of crops . Oats , Wheat , barley , and rye originated in different areas , but because they were all native to relatively similar latitudes they had a large variety of places they could be cultivated . 2 . A greater number of domesticable work / food animals : Cows , horses , sheep , goats , swine , chickens are all native to the Eurasian continent and were able to be densely cultivated across a large number of cultures . Not only was this of obvious utilitarian importance , it also inoculated these denser agricultural populations with zoonotic diseases which would prove crucial in conquest of the Americas . In comparison , Africa , North America , and South America had many fewer animals which could be domesticated , and of the ones they did have , they were not useful for as many purposes and did not thrive outside their native climate . 3 . Access : China / Japan did n't really have anywhere to go . Westward across the Eurasian steppe was just too far to conquer or colonize -- even the Mongol empire rose and fell in about a century -- and Eastward was the * vast * Pacific Ocean . North was Siberia , and South was primitive Polynesia . There was no incentive to expand . Europe , by contrast , was chopped up into many , many smaller states by linguistic and geographical borders . The resulting intense competition drove exploration , and they benefited tremendously from contact with the Near and Far east , south to Africa , and a reasonably practical transatlantic crossing . All of these factors together gave Europe a fairly reasonable boost in terms of the development of their societies , the impetus to explore , and the means to dominate ( militarily or hygienically ) other cultures that were n't as \" advanced . \" Which is not to say that it necessarily had to be this way . There is one final advantage that Europe had over the the Near East , situated smack in the middle between China , Africa , South Asia , and Europe and in prime position to become a world - dominating culture : Europe was much , much farther away from * Mongolia * and so when Genghis Khan and two or three generations of his dynasty ravaged most of Asia , they essentially ended the golden age of the Islamic kingdoms . Europe did n't have that happen , through a combination of geography and historical dumb luck that Genghis Khan 's son Ogedai happened to die right when their hordes were about to pour into Hungary all the way to the Atlantic , because almost all of Europe 's military was away on one of the Crusades .

{"question":"How does regulating the private industry hurt the economy ? With regulations making companies provide quality goods and services , treat employees fairly , and generally be as pleasant and civil as necessary , would n't that actually be helpful ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["The underlying theory of capitalism is that the free market will regulate the economy . For example quality , as a consumer I want quality products but quality products will cost more than poorly made products . Therefore , I need to make a choice either to buy quality or save my money . If everyone decides that they want quality then the cheaper products will go out of business or raise their quality in order to get people to buy it . Ultimately you end up with what most people wanted . Since most people wanted it , it would arguably be in society 's best interest . Regulations force the market to do things without necessarily the analysis I went through . If you force a certain quality on companies then you refuse to allow people to potentially consider cheaper alternatives . Now pollutants get weird because in theory you would argue that if you do n't want companies to pollute , you would n't buy from companies that do . Therefore , all companies would stop polluting in order to get you to come back ( again assuming the majority of people think like you ) . However , if pollution is n't something most people care about , then you should n't force it on the market with regulations . The same can be said with regulations about employee work conditions and safety . Capitalism also assumes employees like anything else is a market . You have a group of people who can choose to work for various companies . If the workers want higher wages or better conditions , then they will go elsewhere and companies will be forced to adjust to get their workers back or shut down . Of course there 's arguments against this that consumers are n't informed enough to force the market to make changes or to learn about companies practices to be able to decide what to do and that workers effectively have no choice but to work . ( This whole argument also ignores monopolies , brand loyalty , and other aspects of market behavior ) This is why most people would argue some regulation is necessary . However , in theory , the market should do what 's best and thus you should n't need governments stepping in and driving up costs for businesses for reasons some people find unnecessary . Tl;dr in theory , the market will decide what is best simply by allowing consumers to make decisions about what products to buy and what companies to support . Regulations force the market to do things that might not necessarily be what most consumers care about and thus hurt the market by forcing companies to pay for things they other would not have to do and increasing costs . I tried to remove politics as much as possible and stick to theoretical framework .","Like most thing in real life , it 's complicated . Private industry are really good at efficiency . If there is a way to keep the production cost low they will find it . And if you have competition that will keep the selling cost low . The more regulation you put on a company , the higher the production cost become . They need to pay for security , increase the worker salary , pay more administration to make sure they follow all regulation , etc . If the production cost increase , they will increase the selling cost or will do less profit . Less profit mean that less investor will want to put their money into the company , which mean that the company will growth less and will created less jobs . Additionally , when you add more regulation it usually cost more to the state because they need people to prepare or make sure that everybody follow these regulation . If it cost more to the state , it need to increase taxes , which also slow down the growth of the economy . But of course , private ownership only have one goal of more profit . So regulation are needed to protect the rights of worker , environment , safety , etc .

I know very little on the topic . Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["In 1990 , Iraq invaded its neighbor , Kuwait . Iraq ( Saddam ) accused the Kuwaitis of \" slant drilling \" or drilling slanted oil wells that withdrew oil from deposits that were within Iraq 's borders . This accusation was a pretense for war , as Iraq owed Kuwait $ 14 billion in debt for financial assistance in a previous war with Iran . Kuwait refused to forgive the debt despite repeated requests by Iraq . After occupying Kuwait , a coalition of several nations led by the U.S. launched the Gulf War during which the Iraqi military was soundly beaten and retreated from Kuwait . The international coalition set up punishments and conditions on Iraq , making it pay for the war costs , establishing no - fly zones over certain airspaces , and requiring that UN inspectors be present in Iraq to monitor its military operations and watch for any developments that could lead to war . Between 1991 - 2002 , Saddam continued to act in belligerent ways , antagonizing the U.S. and its neighbors , chiefly by expelling the UN inspectors . This led the U.S. to adopt a pro - regime change policy aimed at removing Saddam from power . The September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. altered U.S. foreign and military policy significantly . Prior to this , ( and this is post - Cold War ) , U.S. policy generally was to intervene in conflicts only when another country was acting aggressively , and to act \" multi - laterally \" or in conjunction with other allies . After September 11th , the U.S. , under President George W. Bush implemented policies centered on \" preemptively \" engaging in conflict if there was a belief that such action may eliminate or deter a threat to the country , and to act alone ( unilaterally ) if necessary . This policy , which became known as the Bush Doctrine , led the U.S. to invade Afghanistan whose Taliban government harbored Al - Qaeda , the group responsible for the Sept. 11th attacks . The Bush Doctrine , coupled with the policy goal of removing Saddam from power , is what ultimately led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq . In the run up to the war , the CIA and other intelligence officials began issuing reports that Iraq was developing \" weapons of mass destruction \" or WMDs . These included nuclear and chemical weapons . The Bush Administration began building a public case against Iraq ( that Iraq was threatening the U.S. and other countries with its WMDs ) , despite little actual hard evidence that Iraq was developing WMDs . The U.S. and several other countries , through the UN , issued an ultimatum that UN nuclear weapons inspectors must be allowed to inspect Iraqi nuclear and weapons facilities or face \" serious consequences . \" The other members of the UN Security Council stated that they did not intend for those consequences to include invasion . Saddam accepted the ultimatum and allowed inspectors back in the country , who found little evidence of WMDs . Despite this , the Bush Administration continued to push for war , arguing that Saddam was developing WMDs and must be removed from power . The Administration launched a public relations campaign aimed at boosting support for the war , including presenting what was later determined to be false information to the UN . In March of 2003 , President Bush demanded that Saddam and his sons leave Iraq within 48 hours . The U.S. and its allies , outside of UN authority , later began the bombing of Iraq prior to the end of that deadline and the war began . Saddam was a brutal dictator and was considered very evil . He used chemical weapons on civilians , imprisoned and tortured civilians who were dissidents or perceived enemies , and murdered political opponents . His sons , which held significant power as well , were extremely sadistic and engaged in murder and torture as well . Saddam used his power to extort Iraq 's wealth . He was not generally well liked or respected by any other nation , and was considered a disruptive power in the middle east region . Iraq did not have anything to do with the September 11th attacks ( aside from probably providing some support to Al - Qaeda and other terrorist groups ) .

Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Moving air has a lower pressure . The faster it moves , the lower its pressure . When you breathe what you are really doing is opening your lungs and creating a low pressure area inside your body . This means in still air , air rushes into your lungs to fill the area of low pressure . When the air outside is lower pressure it does nt rush in as much , so it feels like breathing is harder . You do n't breathe from your mouth or nose , you breathe from your abdomen . In low enough pressure air you ~~can~~ ca n't force air into your lungs , one of the reasons you need a mask at high altitude","I disagree with all posts on here so far . While there will be pressure differentiation , it wo nt be significant enough to affect anything at the speeds I am assuming OP is talking about . The reason you find it hard to breathe when there is wind blowing at your face is because you are experiencing a sensation that you very rarely feel . Its not that it is necessarily harder , it just requires more thought . You have to regulate the amount of air that comes in , rather than just blindly breathing in and out as you normally do . The air blowing at your face is goes in a lot easier when you breathe in , so your breathing muscle have more control and behave in a way that they never really do . The feeling that you get when wind is blowing in your face and you start to breathe is very short lived and goes away once your body becomes accustom to it .

{"question":"Why was n't WWII fought in the trenches ? The majority to the combat that took place on the Western front was fought in the trenches . Why was n't this the same in World War II ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Because by 1918 all the major powers had figured out how to successfully attack basic trench lines , so anyone who had been foolish enough to try a WWI style trench system would be driven out of it pretty quickly . Probably the best WWI example of this was the British 5th Army which in 1918 was still using 1916 style trenches and was basically destroyed as an effective fighting unit by the German assault in the Spring Offensive . The lesson there was that combined arms ( light machine guns on the attack , combat engineers , artillery support , and tanks if you have them ) allow anyone to crack trench lines at will . The WWI solution to this problem was the \" elastic defense \" , where you have a lightly held \" forward zone \" that serves to warn of the attack ( but is hard to hold due to being in range of enemy field artillery ) , a \" Battle zone \" where the attack will actually be stopped , and a \" rear zone \" to serve as a source of reserves if the battle zone needs them or to counter attack once the enemy is stopped .

{"question":"Why is there an explosion when something breaks the speed of sound ? Side question : does sound have to accelerate , like a car but really fast ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["It 's not an explosion . It 's a loud boom that sounds like an explosion , but nothing is actually exploding . What 's happening is that as the plane moves , it creates sound waves . As the plane accelerates closer and closer to the speed of sound , the sound waves that are already in front of the plane can not outrun the plane or the new sound waves the plane is generating . Eventually , as the plane hits the speed of sound , they all stack up one - on - top - of - another , creating one especially loud sound wave . That 's what a sonic boom is - the overlapping of many sound waves generated at different times by the plane . > does sound have to accelerate , like a car but really fast Sound never accelerates or decelerates , except when it changes medium . So when sound waves hit the earth , some of the energy is reflected back into the air ( and when we hear them , we call them echoes ) . Some of it goes into the ground . When that happens , those ground - traveling waves move faster than they did in the air .","What you are getting is ALL the sound waves from a vehicle hitting you at once . lets say you have a sheet of paper , that we are going to say the ' speed of sound ' on the paper is 1 inch a second . if you draw a dot every second , then , after you 've drawn all of them , make a circle around each dot that is the sound wave from it at the moment it was drawn ( eg : with 11 dots , the first would have a 10 inch radius circle , the second would have a 9 inch diameter circle , and so on , down to a 0 inch radius at the final dot ) , you 'll notice that , if you move less than 1 inch a second , each newer circle will be inside the circle drawn before it , even if you draw in a straight line your circles will never intersect . Now , if we do the same thing , but you draw a dot that is 1 inch farther than the previous one in a straight line ( essentially , moving at the speed of sound ) you 'll see that all the circles intersect at one point that is just at the spot the final dot will be drawn at- that one point is getting ALL the sound waves because it is traveling with them . ( this actually can cause planes to have all sorts of problems from the vibrations staying with the plane- planes do n't like flying at the speed of sound ) Now , if we do that , but move more than once inch between dots , you 'll see that each circle is outside the circle that is from the dot before it , but you 'll notice that , if the distance between dots is consistent the circles tend to all come close to intersecting at two points on the paper ( IRL it 's a ring ) This animation from wikipedia illustrates the final exercise that I just described : URL_0","You just call the sonic boom ' boom ' because it sounds like an explosion and an explosion sounds like that because it accelerates gases beyond the speed of sound . That boom though is merely the overlapping of sound waves created separately but synchronized by a fast moving object amounting to one very high amplitude wave .

It 's just tiny frozen particles of water pulled from the moisture in the atmosphere .","While the simple answer is that snow is indeed ice I 'm willing to bet that you want to know why ice sometimes forms into pretty crystals ( snow flakes ) . When ice starts forming from the atmosphere it first needs something to nucleate on ( start growing ) this can be anything such as grass , car windows etc , basically any surface . When ice forms in these surfaces it pulls water out of the air so that the air surrounding the ice is less moist . As the ice crystals form they become \" spikey \" as the only part of the crystal with enough moisture surrounding it is the tip of the crystal , so the crystal grows along the direction perpendicular to the surface . When this happens we get small spikey crystals called frost . When snow forms it does n't have a surface so it grows in multiple directions which are determined by the temperature and the pressure of atmosphere . At around 0 ° C the crystals grow into dendritic ( branched ) flakes in a hexagonal pattern from a central point ( a snowflake ) . The growth here is the key part as the growth conditions determine the size , shape , number of branches etc and as the conditions will never be exactly the same for any two flakes the flakes will always be unique . If the growth conditions are significantly different from those found in our atmosphere then different forms of ice can grow with different crystal structures ( phases ) rather than flakes ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure!

You do see floating gears a LOT in the trucking world ( heavy duty ) though . Truck transmissions do not have synchronizers , so double clutching or floating is required to change gears . Synchronizers , on a basic level , match the speeds of the input and output shafts , so the gears on each shaft do n't grind when they interact .","In a modern manual transmission the actual gear wheels are in constant contact but freely spin on the output shaft , and the gear selector mechanically connects just one gear wheel at a time to the output shaft .

It turns out that the west dominated a lot of those areas in ways that set back their long term growth and interfered with their economies , stability , politics , cultures , etc . through the colonial period and the cold war , with some animosity still remaining . As a result , those places tend to have less stability and more violence for that reason , not originated from the religion they have .

Qur'an by design is incredibly vague , but the lack of religious head means everyone is allowed to interpret stuff and * * they can not be wrong * * .

This is a highly unstable region with medieval warrior culture , which hates cowardice , praises bravery , and loves revenge to restore honor .

It claims that Jews and Christians are corrupted , and they need to be converted , subjugated , or killed , in that order .

If you were ever in band or orchestra or a musical in high school , you might have noticed that the conductor needed to get a permit to perform the musical or concert piece if there was any money paid for the play .

Current thinking is that planets accrete from materials in the same way that stars do , just on a smaller scale .

That material gradually , due to gravity , starts falling in towards itself , forming clumps , which have more mass , which has more gravity , which draws in more gas and dust . As that material falls inwards , it naturally has angular momentum . That energy is added to the proto - planet as it forms , increasing as more and more matter \" Falls in \" to it . So you end up with a spinning ball of matter , which is sort of an EL5 way to describe a planet . Planets do eventually stop , in the same way that the moon no longer rotates . Eventually the energy that causes them to spin is lost , and they become tidally locked to the body that they are orbiting , like the moon is locked to us .

Similar to how if you start spinning on a swivel chair with your arms out and then pull your arms in , you start to spin faster - conservation of angular momentum . It does n't stop turning because nothing is slowing it down - something that is moving will continue to move unless a force acts against it .

This causes the planet to spin, or rotate, on its axis.\\n\\nThe purpose of a planet's rotation is to create day and night. The rotation of the planet causes the sun to appear to rise in the east and set in the west. This is because the planet is turning towards the sun, so different parts of the planet are facing the sun at different times.\\n\\nA planet will not stop rotating because there is nothing to stop it. There is no friction in space to slow the planet down, so the planet will continue to rotate unless something else, like another planet or celestial body, affects its rotation."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well kiddo, a planet rotates because it's sort of like a top.

Most of the Japanese \" bushido \" code that their servicemen were indoctrinated with was actually pure propaganda with little basis in actual Japanese history . The Soviets were communists and thus had little regard for the burdens placed on individuals when matters of the \" greater good \" were concerned . Thus , Soviet tactics often reflected significant callousness for the safety of their troops . Soviet offensives would often drive straight through minefields rather than bypassing or clearing them because a few dozen or hundred deaths from the mines was entirely acceptable if it meant a successful assault on the Germans . The Soviets also employed special units intended specifically to shoot their own men if they tried to flee . Such tactics were unique amongst the Allies due to the Soviet mindset about the worth of the individual .

{"question":"Why is it that we buy cars from dealerships and not directly from the various automobile producers ? Has it always been like this ? Was there ever a time where we did n't have to go through dealerships to buy cars ? Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["In the early days of the automobile manufacturers did sell directly to the consumer . Then automobile sales began to boom . Manufacturers did n't have the capital to create enough dealerships to sell all their cars in every city across the nation so they franchised out to dealerships . This helped car manufacturers reach consumers fast and get into areas where it was n't feasible to just sell their cars . They could franchise their brands to dealers who sold competitor brands . This allowed continual rapid growth for sales while keeping capital to a minimum . These franchises feared automotive companies would be able to undercut them if they ever decided to build their own dealerships . So they successfully lobbied politicians to create laws prohibiting direct sales . This was done with the belief these laws would protect the small franchises from the large corporations and the belief that dealerships created local jobs . There was also the belief that dealerships created a more personal experience and lowered prices by creating more competition . These dealerships also banded together into networks and fought against OEM 's if they tried to create their own dealerships . Not all states outlaw direct sales , and the Big 3 in the past have tried to sell direct in those states . Yet their own massive independent dealer network would freak out whenever it happened and would threaten to disrupt sales across the country . So even in states where it 's not illegal to sell direct the major manufacturers still sell through dealerships due to threats from other dealers if they do n't . Of course opponents to these regulations see dealerships as nothing more than useless middlemen , especially in an age with so much information available to the consumer . Why should n't cars be sold like most products ? A person can go to an Apple store or Best Buy to get a new Macbook . Heck , they could buy one from the comfort of their own home by buying one online directly from Apple or an Apple dealer . Why ca n't a person do that with a car ? If dealerships truly lowered prices then they have nothing to fear . These laws appear to be useless regulations that provide little benefit to the consumer while adding costs to the process of buying and owning an automobile . Why not let the consumer decide what they value instead of being told how to buy a car ?","I live in Germany . There are of course many dealerships , but the big German car makers ( BMW , Mercedes , Audi , VW , Opel , Porsche , ... ) also run ' branch offices ' in many big cities where they sell directly . They use the same list pricing ( and possible discounts ) like their official dealerships , and when you think of the branch office being run like a dealership , bottom line will make the same margins as the dealers , basically . Of course the branche 's profits go directly into the car manufacturer 's profit , which benefits the car maker , not an independent dealer . So they basically control the supply chain from making the car , marketing , distribution etc . down to the sales the consumers , plus they run aftermarket and service facilities in their branches , too . As another option you can order your car directly with the branch , and then even pick it up at the factory . You can go e.g. to the Volkswagen ' Autostadt ' (= car city ) in Wolfsburg , or BMW in Munich to pick up your shiny new treasure , VW makes a big show out of that by supplying it with a bouquet of flowers from an automated glass storage tower , your can stay even in the Ritz Carlton there and visit their museums and car shows for one or two days , against a fee of course . But you will save the fee of ' transfer from factory ' of a 500 - 100 usd you would be charged when picking it up at the dealer or branch .

Bergdahl fancied himself quite the physical specimen : he thought that he was going to get the attention of higher / ups in the military by walking off - base for a while , through the terrain of Afghanistan , and showing up at some other base to a grand reception later on , where his concerns would be heard . At least , that was the plan in Bergdahls mind . In reality , he was quite conspicuous as a milquetoast white boy in the middle of the afghan desert : the Taliban quickly captured him and took him prisoner , overjoyed to have him as a bargaining chip . The military , upon realization that he was gone , deployed a massive - scale rescue operation to retrieve him , as per the philosophy of ' No man left behind ' .

Plastics are kind of the middle because they are organic compounds with melting points low enough that their chemical bonds are not broken at those temperatures . Burning on the other hand just means you have a compound that is able to be oxidized and an oxidizer(oxygen mostly ) and add to those enough energy to start the exothermic reaction .

Even things like space and time are unique to you . So if you had different senses , like Superman has superhearing , you 'd have a completely different model of reality . 2- what should be ?

{"question":"How does reflection of light on mirrors act on the atomic level ? i do n't actually know if it is a chem or physics question Explain like I'm five. ","human_answers":["Physics rather than chem , and it 's subatomic / wave rather than atomic . Light is a wave ( or a particle , or both , but we 'll stick to wave ) of electromagnetic radiation which travels through a variety of media ( air , vacuum , water etc . ) . Visible light is made up of several different wavelengths which we see as colours . The important thing here is that , as a wave , it is carrying energy . When light hits an object , it can be pass through , be absorbed , reflect or scatter , or any combination of these . When the light wave hits the mirror , the energy from the lightwave is absorbed by the atoms . This pushes electrons into higher energy states . This is n't a stable condition , and so the electrons release the energy . In a perfectly reflective surface , all of the absorbed energy is spat back out , perfectly mirroring the incoming energy . Across the entire surface of the mirror , this leads to the light being absorbed and then spat back out in a way that produces a \" good \" reflection .","Okay , so first thing to note is that light is an electromagnetic wave , the photon is the carrier particle for the electromagnetic force . When we 're talking about optical effects , we are talking about electromagnetism , which means there are only three ( mostly two ) particles we have to consider : Electrons , Protons , and Photons . Electrons and Protons both respond to the electromagnetic force , but Protons are almost always shielded by an atom 's electron shell , so they almost never interact with light . Electrons inhabit orbitals , which are basically imaginary shells that surround the nucleus of an atom . They can move from one orbital to another by gaining or losing energy , but they have to gain or lose enough energy to move a while number of orbitals . For example , an electron could jump 2 or 3 orbitals , but not 1.5 orbitals . When a photon approaches an atom , if the photon can excite an electron into a higher orbital , that photon is absorbed , then the electron jumps back down to its original state ( electrons always want to be in the lowest available orbital ) and releases a photon of slightly lower energy as the atom recoils , having absorbed some of the photon 's momentum as heat ( heat is just kinetic energy at tiny scales ) . If a photon does n't have the right energy to excite an electron , it passes right on by , if it hits an atom directly , it is deflected rather than absorbed , which lengthens the path the light takes through the material , which is what causes the speed of light to appear to change in different materials . This is why glass is transparent to visible light . A reflective surface has a lot of free electrons , which are not in orbitals and thus do n't have to absorb specific photons to be excited ( though they will have trouble with very high energy photons because they just knock electrons right out of the metal , or fly right through them via quantum tunneling ) , so they take all comers and and reflect them according to the same rules .","What everyone else has said is correct ; photons ( light ) being absorbed by electrons ( subatomic particles ) will excite them , and then they emit their own photon of equal wavelength . You can see [ this ] ( URL_1 ) diagram for a visual aid . What this does n't explain is why * metals * ( which are basically mirrors without glass in front ) are so good at reflecting light . I would like to go into the Chemistry aspect of this , though , if it 's not too late -- since that is the study of atoms , after all . Note : it may help to have a periodic table open in another tab . \" Free electrons \" is a term I saw in another answer . This basically means that the atom has a lot of electrons not strongly attracted to the parent atom . Can you guess which atoms have the most free electrons ? The answer is metals ! Check out a periodic table , and the whole middle section will be the transition metals . If you think about some of the characteristics of metals , they can be explained by their electron structure . First , they 're good conductors of electricity , something that directly deals with electron exchange , and second , they 're shiny , which relates to what we 're talking about . They 're also strong at oxidizing , which is part of why batteries work the way they do . Hell , their electron structure is the reason that when you breathe , oxygen gets transported around your body the way it does . This is where the Chemistry begins . Again , I recommend a [ periodic table ] ( URL_0 ) if you 're reading this . I 'm going to try and put this into ELI5 . I 'd be happy to explain if I do n't do it justice . Basically , around every atom , there are electrons . These are separated into orbitals , named * s * , * p * , * d * , and * f * orbitals ( do n't worry about * f * , that 's some Nuclear Chemistry shit ) . Only the outermost orbital contains electrons usable in reactions , and these are known as valence electrons located in a valence shell ; the other ones are tucked away for the most part . Obviously , as the orbitals grow and grow in diameter , they get further and further from the nucleus of the atom , and are less attracted to it . This is what that \" free electron \" reference meant ; these really far - out electrons are only barely associated with the nucleus and are pretty much free to do whatever they want . Metals have valence electrons in the * d * orbital ( which is the middle chunk of the periodic table ) , and so have plenty of free electrons when compared to an atom with valence electrons in the * p * orbital or * s * orbital . Metals are , to conclude , what makes mirrors shiny . As long as the surface is very , very flat , metals will reflect light very well . I hope I have explained why ."],"chatgpt_answers":["On the atomic level, light is made up of tiny packets of energy called photons. When light hits a mirror, it bounces off the surface of the mirror.

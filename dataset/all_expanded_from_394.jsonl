{"question":"Why is the AK-47 such a popular weapon and why is it not used by british and US armed forces ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["It takes 15 minutes to learn a person who have never seen a gun before to use and maintain a AK47 . For an M16 rifle you need the better part of a week . The AK47 is altso cheap and easy to make so in very little time and for very little money ( relative ) you could ship ten thousands of AK47 to a conflict area . Its altso solid enough to use as a shovel , it does not mind beeing wet inside , sand and dirt makes it laough , its ammo will punch through brick walls and threes , you can run over it with a truck and it will just blow its nose and you can take a boltcarrier from an russian AK made in the 50 's , a romanian reciever from the 80 's and a chinese magazine made today and put together a frankenstein gun that will work flawlessly ... None of these things can be said of the standard M16","It 's the world 's most popular assault rifle , a weapon all fighters love . An elegantly simple nine pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood , it does n't break , jam , or overheat . It will shoot whether it 's covered in mud or filled with sand . It 's so easy even a child can use it , and they do . The Soviets put the gun on a coin , Mozambique put it on their flag . Since the end of the Cold War , the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people 's greatest export . After that comes vodka , caviar , and suicidal novelists .","AK47s robustness and reliability has nothing to do with its popularity . The reasons for popularity are two : First reason is that an AK47 is extremely easy to manufacture from basic materials and following in the best Soviet tradition you do not need high tolerances to make it work so the parts do n't need to be perfect . The only automatic guns which were simpler than an AK were British Sten and American Grease Gun from WW2 . Unlike both of them AK is a better and more reliable and is an actual assault rifle capable of shooting rifle ammunition - proper 7.62 mm bullets . This meant it was the perfect weapon for developing countries without a huge industrial base - most of the third world . You did n't need huge factories and skilled workforce . The second reason was political . AK was licensed for close to nothing by the USSR to every country which wanted to get on anti - imperialist bandwagon . It was also exported in huge amounts directly from the USSR . You wanted to overthrow imperialists ! Here you go . That 's how China got their AK clones . That 's how Vietcong and other insurgent movements in South East Asia got theirs . That 's how half of Africa got theirs . It was also the standard weapon of the Warsaw Pact armies . [ Here ] ( URL_1 ) is a list of countries which produced their variants of AK47 either on license or without it . When those countries wanted to earn some money they were selling AK47s to governments , new regimes , insurgent forces , revolutionaries ... And because there were so many copies , variants and knock - offs it was near impossible to track down which formal variant or license was used to manufacture which rifle . Combine that with the general approach to licenses in the Soviet Union ( capitalist nonsense ! ) and you essentially get an * * Open Source Assault Rifle * * . Anyone anywhere with access to basic metalworking tools could build an AK47 . That would not be possible with Western mode of arms production which was proprietary and made for profit and if someone started knocking off an M16 or FN Fal there would be court cases and other similar stuff . So if you needed cheap gun that you can manufacture at home when the need arises AK47 was your pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As for the reasons why it was n't adopted by Western armies there are again two reasons which mirror the causes of Ak47 's huge * non*commercial success First was that AKs robustness , simplicity and reliability came at the expense of accuracy and weight . AK47s were barely accurate beyond 100 - 200 m and they were heavy and heavier still if made from poor quality materials . They were also relatively uncomfortable to use . An AK is a bit clunky in handling which is why they were constantly improved . Ak74 which was the 5.45 mm variant was one such improvement . The Israelis had modified the AK to produce their standard rifle IAI Galil . The main advantage of AKs were numbers and low cost . Many countries went the opposite route and manufactured more sophisticated and accurate weapons that tried to improve on the design . While Americans worked through more classic M16 to M4 the Brits , French and some other countries tried [ bullpup ] ( URL_0 ) configuration in their SA80 , AUG , FAMAS etc . Second reason was political naturally . Apart from the awkwardness of using an enemy design in the West selling arms was a huge and profitable * business * . Defense spending is as much about providing tools for defense as it is about jobs for voters and kick - offs to donors . Large European countries had arms manufacturers which wanted to do something more than produce guns on American license because a ) it is less profitable with license fees b ) less prospective for future operations . So the ability to produce guns at home coupled with protectionist approach to most \" defense industries \" meant that every country with its own factory capable of building decent guns was making their own model . And sometimes that meant a highly modified AK ! Just for the sake of selling an unique product on their own rules . Small countries were buying guns produced by larger manufacturers in government - sponsored deals where half of the negotiations to buy say FN guns or M16s would be not between the ministry of defense and the manufacturer but between the politicians of both countries negotiating who is going to take what bribe ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The AK-47 is a popular weapon because it is simple, reliable, and easy to use.

These weapons are often more advanced and better suited to the specific needs of their armed forces. They may also be more expensive or require more maintenance than the AK-47.

For example, if a street starts at 0 or 1, the first building on the left side of the street might be numbered 2, and the second building might be numbered 4, and so on. The numbering continues on each side of the street, so the first building on the right side of the street might be numbered 1, and the second building might be numbered 3, and so on. \nThis system can result in seemingly random or irregular numbering, especially on long streets or blocks. For example, if a street runs for several miles, the numbers may increase by 100 or more for each block. This means that you might see a building with the number 22097 next to a building with the number 22092. \nIn some cases, the street numbers may also be affected by historical factors or changes in the layout of the street or neighborhood. For example, if a street was originally laid out in a different pattern or if buildings were added or removed over time, it can result in seemingly random or irregular numbering. \nOverall, the system of street numbering in the United States is designed to help people find specific addresses and locations easily and efficiently.

The Confederate government was able to generate money by issuing bonds, which were essentially loans that people or organizations could buy. The government promised to pay back the bonds with interest at a later date.

The Confederate army was made up of volunteers who signed up to fight for the cause. Many of these volunteers were farmers, shopkeepers, and other civilians who were not professional soldiers. The Confederate government was also able to create units quickly because it had access to military bases, weapons, and other supplies that had been left behind by the United States government when the Southern states seceded. \nFinally, it's worth noting that the Confederacy did have some prior preparation for military conflict. Some Southern states had been building up their militias (local military units) and stockpiling weapons in anticipation of a possible conflict with the North.

All living creatures are constantly breaking down , and repairing themselves with new cells . When they ca n't fix the broken parts , they begin to fail , and death is on the way . The rate the break down / repair happens , and the amount of times a cell can be replaced , varies by animal , resulting in drastically different lifespans . It 's worth mentioning , that in nature , animals ( including humans ) rarely live to this point . Predators , accidents , sickness , and excessive wear and tear ( teeth worn to the point they ca n't eat , for instance ) are generally what causes death . Dying of \" old age \" requires a very safe environment .","Evolution selects for successful reproduction . The entire goal of a species is to create as many successful offspring of itself and to get those offspring to a point that they can procreate on their own . Depending on the species and their breeding habits , it may take days or decades to reach sexual maturity . Once they reproduce , certain species no longer care for their young . In these cases having the mature adult compete with the offspring for food is disadvantageous . Other species require care until the young can fend for themselves . In these cases , the additional resources needed to sustain the parent for a longer period of time is outweighed by the protection / training they can afford the next generation . Species that can remain sexually active through longer periods of their life will also have less invested in each individual reproduction cycle , so evolution might select for trading caring for their young for multiple reproductive cycles throughout their lifespan .

This is influenced by multicore and general core design so a 3GHz processor from today is multiple times faster than a 3GHz processor from 8 years ago . RAM/\"Memory \" : The memory banks on your Mainboard . These are 100x faster than your Hard Drives and still MUCH slower than the CPU cache . Basically a middle ground . Think writing the numbers on a sheet of paper while dividing 1199/32 and counting the carry on your fingers ( cache ) . A basic operation example looks like this : From when you booted your PC , there is already a table on how letters are supposed to look stored in your RAM . If you press a letter on your keyboard now , the input code ( for example \" 82 \" in binary ) is transmitted by your Mainboard to your CPU . The CPU now utilizes its cache and executes various \" op codes \" that basically tell it to take the letter code , grab the relevant info from the RAM , write it back into the memory of the program you are using and at the same time tell your GPU that it shall update the current screen with the new letter \" R \" at a certain position .","processor : does the processing ( calculation ) , made up of millions of transistor ( an electronic switch just like any switch to make or break connection but very tiny and fast ) . Famous manufacturing company : Intel , AMD etc GHz(10 ^ 9 hz or cycles per second ) : clock speed , clock is basically a square wave and it turns out your processor 's job is to execute instructions ( programs = set of instruction ) and it takes some cycles of this square wave for each instruction to get executed , more GHz means more clock speed means if your instruction take 4 clock cycles to execute then increasing clock speed would decrease the time it take to execute that instruction because in same 1 second time more no of cycles are being passed to processor . so if we talk about dual core then 2.2 Ghz is faster than 1.8 Ghz video / graphics card : your processor is enough busy running numerous task ( front and background applications ) so it is better to have a seperate processor for graphics heavy applications unless you want your screen to freeze time to time . So it is a graphics processor with its own clock speed to work on like 820 Mhz etc , it also has its own RAM that s why 2 gb ram graphic card . RAM : volatile memory , data remains as long as power in it after that it vanish Hard disk : computer storehouse : u dump ur games , video , porn ? here BUSES : wires that connect all these stuff and let data flow between them Motherboard : put all these components onto this board power supply : supply power working : switch on pc- > current runs everywhere inside- > bootloader loads some set of instruction permanently stored in ROM onto processor - > it then loads OS - > several processes comes alive and you have ur desktop screen in front of you - > u click batman arkham origin - > data from harddisk runs to ram and then to processor - > processor identifies it needs graphics card too - > data flows to graphic card , it processes and send that to ram from there to your screen all this transfer is through PCIe lanes ( very fast lanes like freeways or highways ) - > you click and respond and kick some ass"],"chatgpt_answers":["Sure!

At one point , those were blocked due to an economic dispute . This led to a massive airlift operation , delivering 4700 tons of supplies per day , with almost 200 000 flights per day .

There are algorithms called \" genetic algorithms . \" The key of these algorithms is that a data stream that is exactly analogous to DNA dictates the behavior of the system , while the algorithm is static and controls mutation , breeding , and fitness . These equations can be used for just about anything . You can literally breed more fuel efficient engines , more aerodynamic cars and planes , you can teach robots to do their job , virtual creatures to walk , or survive in their virtual environments ; these algorithms do make their way into physical robots in industrial production and research labs . The DNA data can be arbitrarily long and represent arbitrarily complicated behavior . To some degree , complexity can be so high that humans basically ca n't explain how it 's working . One famous demonstration used genetic algorithms to configure a programmable processor to recognize human voice . After 40k generations , in software , over the course of a couple weeks , the hardware device was able to identify a human voice perfectly , and the scientists had absolutely no clue how it worked . Parts of the circuit were wired in weird ways and did n't connect to anything . When they removed that part of the circuit , the device stopped working . They could only reason that the algorithm implicitly took advantage of some electrical resonance or bleeding across circuits of that exact , particular , specific processor ( there are always manufacture flaws and variations between chips in a batch ) . There are software and now some fantastic hardware that represents neurons of the brain . These virtual neurons can be wired into a network , usually virtually . They 're allowed to rewire themselves with static algorithms that determine when a change is necessary , and each neuron can \" learn \" ; they use little equations to determine if they 're supposed to signal their outputs depending on their inputs , and this builds neural path ways . These algorithms are used in cochlear ( hearing ) implants , they 're used in stock market trading , they 're used in robots and vision systems , they 're popular in \" learning AI \" . Robots and virtual creatures can learn to walk and navigate a maze . They can simulate learning and memory . You 're basically making a little brain . In fact , Google finished a research project a few months ago where they simulated a small brain .

How do officers get necessary information like specific addresses or assigned to calls ? US resident Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Dispatcher here . I dispatch for a sheriffs office in a ski county . Our dispatch center dispatches for the county deputies , the state troopers , the park rangers , the wildlife officers , the US forest service officers , and local fire and EMS . As far dispatching law enforcement goes , each agency has a certain jurisdiction , and if a call happens in their jurisdiction we usually send one ( or multiple ) units depending on the call . For example the state troopers take all of the calls on the state roads and interstates ( accidents , traffic violations , road hazards , suspicious vehicles on the interstate , etc ) . The county deputies take all of the calls on county roads , and county property . These calls may include domestic violence calls at a citizens houses , burglary alarms , citizen complains against each other , welfare checks , and civil problems . They also patrol the area proactively trying to prevent crime . They have a job very similar to a city police officer . The park rangers take care of all of the problems in state park jurisdiction , and the wildlife officers generally ride around on ATVS and look for poachers , and take care of the wildlife people encounter on their property . The US forest officer takes the calls in the national forest in our jurisdiction and patrols the highway the passes through it . He may also receive help from our deputies if need be because we have a deputy whose zone passes through his national forest . We also have a local police department in the area , but their dispatch is in another location and we occasionally coordinate . We can hear each others radio traffic , but do n't dispatch each others officers . Now , there are about 6 troopers ( Highway patrol ) on air in the busiest time , and they are separated into 3 zones . Each trooper is assigned a zone , and if we receive a call in their zone we generally ask them to respond . If all the troopers in their zone are unavailable , we ask the officer in charge to advise . The deputies have 4 zones with 6 deputies on duty . 4 deputies have their own zone ( so one in each zone ) and there is a float who will respond to any call if an officer is busy , and another call comes in in their zone . There is also a SGT on duty who is the boss of the crew . If a call comes in their zone , they are dispatched to it , and if deputies from another zone come to assist , the officer who is assigned to that zone will be in charge of the call ( write the big report , and if needed , take the prisoner into the jail ) . When we take a call our system automatically recognizes the address and maps it for us , and we can see whose zone it is in , and we send that unit . Generally , there is a unit available to assist if they need backup , and all officers in every agency will back each other if they feel they are in a dangerous situation . We have a computer aided dispatch system that tracks all of the calls , and what every unit is doing , so we know if they are available , unavailable , their location and how long they have been on that call so we can security check them if need be .

Good lenses are fiendishly expensive , and can make the difference between a \" good \" picture and a fantastic picture . A surprisingly good and approachable video about lenses . It 's more focused on video , but the same holds true for still . URL_0","Depends on the cameras . In some cases , absolutely . In others , definitely not . Most of the time though , the answer is ' sort of . ' A Hasselblad Stellar is entirely identical to a Sony RX-100 except for the case , but when it came out , sold for about five times the price . In this situation , the markup was entirely based on the cachet of owning a Hasselblad . ( Note : It did n't work . The design studio has been shut down , and the Stellar is selling for about 70 % off now . ) In general , a big part of the cost of a camera is derived from the sensor - specifically , the size of it . The Nikon D7100 is quite similar in design and features to the D600 , but the sensor in the D600 is substantially bigger ( full - frame ) , and the camera sells for about twice the price . Does the sensor cost that much more ? No , not really - but building a camera around it requires more engineering as well . Now if you have a built - in lens , your optics are going to get better as the price increases . That 's a HUGE factor in the price of a camera . Ultimately , cameras follow the same curve as almost every other consumer product : As you move from the low end to the high end , the improvement / price starts out high , then moves to a fairly steady value , then drops off . Say that to make a ( separate ) camera at all , you 'll have to sell it for $ 75 . That 's the base cost of making a body , shutter , electronics , and lens . Double the price , and you get MORE than twice as good of a camera - higher precision , better autofocus , more features , bigger and better lens , bigger sensor , the works . Double it again to $ 300 , and you get about twice as good of a camera as the $ 150 was . Another doubling , and you get about 1.6x as good of a camera . Now we 're getting into the diminishing returns area . The key here is n't whether a $ 1200 camera is twice as good as a $ 600 one , but whether it 's enough of an improvement that you are willing to pay an extra $ 600 for it . Is a $ 2400 camera twice as good as a $ 1200 ? Nope , definitely not - but it 's significantly better in a few ways , and those factors might be enough to get you to shell out the difference . Also , if you have $ 30k wrapped up in lenses , is it really outrageous to buy a camera body for $ 4k that is modestly better than a $ 1k one ?

In order to represent the wave in digital form , the sequence of numbers representing the wave amplitude measured periodically is used . The illustrations that probably will make it clear : [ 1 ] ( URL_2 ) , [ 2 ] ( URL_1 ) . When music is played back , the audio card converts this sequence of numbers back into the wave . Obviously , this conversion loses some quality : the resulting wave is an approximation of the original one .

Most common values are 44100 , 48000 , and 96000 . Bit depth is how many data is written for each measurement . 16 bits means that there are 2 ^ 16 = 65536 possible different values of amplitude . 24 bits means 16777216 different values .

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["In the quantum model of atoms , electrons are not represented with points , since you ca n't determine where these electrons are /exactly/. Instead , you draw these balloon - shapes orbitals , which are sort of where the electrons are most likely found . In a molecule , these orbitals can overlap , and this overlap causes new hybrid orbitals to form .","Everyone is familiar with the model of an atom where you have a positive nucleus , with negative electrons whizzing around in circles , we call these circles orbitals , where the orbital number goes up the further away from the nucleus you are . An electron can only be located in these orbitals , never between them , think of it like a ladder . You can climb up a ladder , but you only stand on each individual rung . This is , for many things , a good picture . However , we know that it is * not * how things actually look . We know this because physicists are really good at playing the \" if this , then ... \" game . Basically , if electrons were actually in circular orbits around the nucleus , the structure of the atom would n't be stable , and we would n't be here to ask any kind of question ( I can go further into this if you want , but I 'm mostly just trying to provide a backstory for why we have ) . So , what 's a better picture ? Well , the blob shapes that you 've seen / dealt with in molecular orbital theory . Here 's why . One of the most fundamental bits of quantum mechanics is something called the Schrodinger Equation ( SE ) . There is a lot of mathematical formalism that I 'll skip over here , but the SE is useful because it allows us to solve , given certain physical conditions , the behaviour of a particle . As a result of the SE , we learn that very small particles do n't behave in the way that say , a baseball would , where we can say \" The pitcher threw the ball , at this speed , and we can track it 's location from here , to here , to here , to ... \" Instead , we learn that tiny things , like electrons , have * probabilities * of being certain places , traveling certain speeds , etc , and when we measure one of those things ( see : Heisenberg uncertainty principle for more ) , we reduce how well we can know the other , because the act of measuring affects the actual thing . Think of it like if you had to measure where a baseball was between where the pitcher threw it and the batter hit it by smacking it with another baseball . Obviously , you would disturb it 's original trajectory , so you could n't know where it would be after you measure it with much certainty . So , physicists start solving the SE for specific things to see how a tiny particle would behave under certain circumstances that are very basic ; the most basic being the particle in the infinite potential well . Imagine a particle , stuck in a deep hole . It can bounce around , have more / less energy , but ca n't escape the hole . Let 's imagine that this is a very tiny particle now , so that we are dealing with the SE . Well , if we solve the SE we find that the particle can have different energy levels ( again , think rungs on a ladder ; so the particle can exist in different heights from the bottom of the hole ) . Our solutions to the SE are waves ( sine , cosine ) . When use follow the rules of probability theory and Born 's rule ( which is a rule about how we measure probabilities in quantum mechanics ) we can find that we can calculate the probability of [ where the particle is in our well ] ( URL_0 ) , given different energy levels . The peaks of the graphs represent the most likely place , while the nodes are zero probability . Eventually , physicists solve the SE for the specific set of circumstances that an electron would have if bound to a proton ; e.g. \" in orbit around a proton \" if you are still thinking in the orbital / planetary picture of an atom . An electron going around a proton ? Well , that 's a hydrogen atom . So , when the SE was solved for the hydrogen atom , in three dimensions , physicists could solve for the different energy levels ( orbital levels ) of the electron . This would be like the graph above , where there are areas of high probability , lower probability , and no probability ( like the space between orbitals , where the electron is not allowed ) . This graph though is more complicated because we have three dimensions now instead of one dimension . The \" blobs \" give you the areas where there is a probability of finding an electron , and , like the particle in a well , different energy levels ( n=1,2 , ... ) give differently shaped solutions . These arise because the solutions to the Hydrogen atom are a specific set of equations called spherical harmonics [ that give rise to solutions that look like this ] ( URL_1 ) . For atoms other than hydrogen , the system gets too complicated to solve in closed form , except for specific cases where an atom can sort of look like a hydrogen atom ( like if all the electrons have been stripped away except one ) . * However * physicists ( and chemists ! ) are a bunch of pretty smart guys , and take these solutions to qualitatively ( and sometimes quantitatively ) analyze a system . Bonding between atoms ( depending on the type of bond being formed ) happen when energy levels get crossed between atoms ; which happens in fairly specific ways , with some being more common than others because they are more energetically favourable . These blobs correspond to different \" strengths \" or bonding energies ( sigma , pi bonds ... ) . Chemists and physicists characterize the energy levels / shells by how they get filled with electrons . This is your 1s , 2p , etc . The rules of quantum mechanics , and solutions to the SE give you these different energy levels or \" shells . \" Even though it is * very * difficult ( or impossible ? ) to solve the SE for high Z atoms and molecules , we can solve ( sometimes numerically ) for these things by assuming certain forms of solutions ( the different blobs ) and knowing how likely things are to happen , and exploiting symmetries . These are the ( sometimes complicated ) rules that chemists know for how molecular bonding happens . Let me know if you have any more questions . I 'm decent at the physics , less familiar with the chemistry side ( it was a while ago that I had those classes ) . If others want to add / correct me on anything , please do . What I 've posted is my understanding of what OP asked , and does n't necessarily mean it 's 100 % correct , and the interpretation can sometimes be misguided .","OK , well basically , electrons like to gather in groups , called Orbitals .

In general relativity, gravity is not a force that acts between masses like it is in classical physics. Instead, gravity is a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of matter or energy. Imagine that spacetime is like a rubber sheet, and objects with mass or energy cause a depression in the rubber sheet. The curvature of the rubber sheet then causes other objects to be \"pulled\" towards the massive object, as if it were a gravitational force. \nNow, imagine that you are standing on a trampoline with a bowling ball in the center. If you were to roll a smaller ball towards the bowling ball, the smaller ball would be \"pulled\" towards the bowling ball due to the depression in the trampoline caused by the bowling ball's mass. This is similar to how objects are \"pulled\" towards each other due to gravity in general relativity. \nBut what does this have to do with acceleration? In classical physics, acceleration is the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time. In general relativity, an object's velocity is determined by the path it follows through spacetime. If the path is curved, the object will appear to be accelerating, even if it is not actually changing its velocity. \nFor example, imagine that you are standing on the trampoline again, but this time you are rolling a ball in a straight line towards the bowling ball. As the ball approaches the bowling ball, it will start to follow the curve of the trampoline, and it will appear to be accelerating towards the bowling ball.

The program has been the subject of controversy because many people believe that torture is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. \nThere are several reasons why people are angry about the CIA torture program: \n1. Many people believe that torture is wrong because it goes against fundamental human rights and dignity. The United States has long held that all people have certain inalienable rights, including the right to be free from torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. By torturing terrorism suspects, the CIA was violating these fundamental rights. \n2. The effectiveness of torture as an interrogation technique has been called into question. Many experts believe that torture is not an effective way to gather reliable information, as people who are being tortured will often say anything to make the torture stop, even if it is not true. In addition, the use of torture can create a climate of fear and mistrust, which can make it more difficult to gather accurate intelligence. \n3. The CIA torture program was carried out in secret, and many people believe that it was done in an effort to cover up the program and avoid accountability.

So I might make a really hard class but give people with an 85 an A.

A longer version ... for grades , generally a University cares about 2 things , which are closely related . How well a student has mastered material , and how capable a student is of mastering material . If a student is about average , they should be receiving a C , good , B , amazing , A. So why does n't this translate directly to percentages ? In short , because not all professors are good at translating an assessment of their knowledge to standard percentages . Take something like Quantum Physics ; I 've had a class where the average on a midterm was ~20 - 30 % , with the amazing students getting 40 % . Now , that may speak to the professor being terrible ( for some definition of terrible ) , it may speak to terrible students , or it may be because the test was designed to be so difficult that a student could only complete 2 - 3 out of 5 problems in the time given , but half the test was in recognizing which of those problems a student could complete best . If the whole class is designed like this , and \" percentages \" are used , someone outside looking at the scores from the class would simply only view a student 's score in isolation , see it as depressingly low , and view it as a mark against the student , even if they had the highest score in the class . Grades , then , are a way for the professor of the class to say \" Well , I was using a teaching / grading method that does n't match up exactly to your expectation of 90%+ = Great student , anything below 60 is awful , but here 's a way to view my evaluations in a standardized way . \"","Something else that has n't been mentioned yet , sometimes the school does n't want you to get tied up in minor differences .

The 4-point GPA scale is the most commonly used scale in the United States, and it assigns a numerical value to each letter grade, with 4.0 being the highest possible GPA and 0.0 being the lowest. \nThere are a few reasons why the GPA system is used in the United States instead of percentage grades. First, the GPA system allows for a more nuanced understanding of a student's grades. While a percentage grade gives a general idea of how well a student has performed, the GPA system allows for more precise comparisons between students. \nSecond, the GPA system is more flexible than percentage grades. For example, if a student receives a 90% on one assignment and an 80% on another, their average percentage grade would be 85%. However, if the first assignment was worth twice as much as the second assignment, the student's grades would be weighted differently, and the GPA would reflect that. \nFinally, the GPA system is more widely used in the United States, so it is easier for universities to compare the grades of students from different schools. This can be particularly helpful when evaluating the academic achievements of international students, as different countries may use different grading systems. \nOverall, the GPA system is a convenient and widely accepted way of measuring academic achievement in the United States.

{"question":"in video games , why are shadows so hard to render ? I notice that even in games with incredibly detailed graphics shadows are often pixelated or very low resolution . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Drawing shadows is hard . The way shadows are calculated is by placing a second camera at the light source , and then rendering the scene from the light source 's point of view into a temporary location . The image that is produced is not a typical \" camera image \" . Instead every pixel of this image records the distance between the light source and the object hit by the light - this is called a \" shadow map \" . Once you have this shadow map , the regular scene is drawn . While drawing the regular scene , it has to calculate the lighting for each pixel in the regular scene . Let 's say a particular pixel on the regular scene represents location X in the scene ( it has an exact 3D location in the scene ) . The distance of location X to the light source is compared against the distance recorded in the shadow map , this determines whether location X is in shadow or not . In other words , rendering shadows requires rendering an extra scene ( the shadow map ) for * each * light source in the scene , greatly reducing FPS . So a game with just one light source with accurate shadows would have its FPS halved , 2 light sources would cause FPS to be reduced to 1/3 . This is somewhat circumvented by rendering low resolution shadow maps instead ( less pixels to render per shadow map ) , resulting in pixelated or low resolution shadows , because each pixel on the shadow map covers a \" larger \" area . Edit : Halving and 1/3 FPS is a huge exaggeration , it is not that bad ( because ELI5 ) , it ignores the CPU side of calculating the scene , updating AIs , etc . The point I 'm driving across is simply that more scenes are drawn per frame .","I 'm a graphics engine programmer by profession , so I 've programmed engines that handle real - time shadows quite a few times . There are different techniques to shadows , each one costs something in performance and has drawbacks . ----- * * Stencil shadows * * , used in Doom 3 and F.E.A.R. , calculate what areas should be occluded ( within shadow ) by taking a light source and tracing lines from the light source to each vertex on a polygon , this is mostly done on the CPU . Where these lines pass through polygons a new mesh is created , which is rendered to the stencil buffer and creates sharp shadows that describe where the meshes are visible ( Basically where those lines from the light connect with polygons ) . This effectively generates a sharp representation of shadows against surfaces ( more or less generates something that describes the clipping of shadows ) . It is mathematically intensive and requires a fast CPU , something that game consoles do n't typically have when compared with desktop PCs so this method performs better on PCs where a CPU is quite powerful . This method is not used very much these days . ----- The other technique which is quite popular these days ( easy to implement ) is * * shadow mapping * * , which takes advantage of the GPU to draw what each light \" sees \" by moving the camera to where the light is facing , drawing what it sees to just the depth buffer ( So it knows how far away what it is seeing is ) . Once the depth information is gathered , the camera moves back to the normal view and draws the world normally , however it keeps the shadow camera 's depth buffer and position at hand and when the GPU is drawing the material of objects you 're looking it ( textures , lighting , etc ) it will check the position of the object you 're looking at , then it will use the equation for the shadow camera 's position and find out how far away that position is from the shadow camera , then it uses the shadow camera 's depth buffer to see if it is further away than the depth value in the same X / Y position on that depth buffer . If it is , then it is in shadow , if it is n't , then it is in light . This option moves the intense maths to the GPU but costs GPU memory for the shadow cameras ' depth buffers , also you need to repeat the operation for every single shadow - casting light source , which means you are drawing the game world multiple times in one frame . Very expensive . To have more accurate shadows you need a higher resolution depth texture , which means slower pixel lookups , more memory used , worse performance * * < - This is why you have pixellated shadows * * Also you do n't always want hard shadows , so some materials will define how blurry the shadow it receives is which means extra maths for the GPU to do . Consoles can cope with this better as they have powerful GPUs compared to their CPUs , PCs also benefit from this as it scales well with hardware ( So if you can support high resolution shadows you can choose to use them ) . Games typically only use 1 shadow source for shadow mapping ( the Sun ) because they want to dedicate more time to making the rest of the scene look good rather than having multiple shadows , some of which you wo n't even see . And all this needs to be done in under 16.666~ milliseconds for 60 FPS . ----- Here 's a summary of shadow mapping ; 1 . Move camera to shadow - casting light 2 . Draw what that light \" sees \" to its own depth buffer 3 . Repeat N times for every shadow that effects the scene 4 . Move camera to player point of view 5 . Upload all shadow depth buffers to GPU 6 . Upload all camera matrices for each shadow casting light 7 . Draw what the player sees as normal 8 . Draw materials ( textures , etc ) 9 . Take the world position of the fragment ( pixel ) that is being drawn 10 . Translate that with each matrix of the shadow camera to get its position on the depth buffer in the perspective of the shadow camera 11 . Check if the fragment we want to draw is \" behind \" the fragment that is in the same position on the shadow cameras ' depth buffers 12 . If it is behind a depth buffer fragment , render as if in shadow ( Darken it by some factor , check samples around the same point to see how blurry the shadow is , calculate new material values , etc , etc ) ----- From the \" Draw materials ( textures , etc ) \" point onwards everything is done on the fragment shader , which means that those steps are repeated for every visible pixel and every pixel that you ca n't see ( so stuff drawn behind objects that are about to be covered up by objects ) , and with matrix mathematics being so expensive you can imagine that doing all that for every pixel in a 1920x1080 image is very expensive , hence why most games stick with 1 shadow source and choose to make that 1 look really good . ----- Extra ; I saw someone mention * * pre - baked shadows * * , this moves the shadow rendering stage to the content generation stage which means highly accurate shadows can be produced and the only performance cost is having an extra texture for the surface shadow ( Unless your engine is clever and streams textures with the pre - baked shadows on them , i d Tech 5 ) . The obvious draw - back to pre - baked shadows is that they can not move . The less - obvious draw - back ( that Doom 3 attempted to solve ) is that the models in the world wo n't be shadowed in the same way as the pre - baked textures as models are expected to move around , this means they need a different lighting model to the world which means they will always look out of place . This is known as the \" Hanna - Barbera effect \" , where things that move look very much out of place compared to the background they are drawn on . ----- Extra 2 ; Another shadowing concept that is usually forgotten about is * * ambient occlusion * * , which is where light photons bounce off objects and slightly illuminate areas that are in shadow . This causes an effect where two surfaces near each other will have photons bounce more and more between the surfaces , losing energy as they do , which causes the surfaces to produce dark shadows closer to where they meet . Games cheat this by using a technique first shown in Crysis ( 2007 ) where the depth buffer is once again used to check how close objects are to each other , where the objects are close it will draw a fuzzy dark patch which is later blurred with a gaussian blur to produce the ambient occlusion for the scene . This is then used with the final rendered frame to produce further shadows . Ambient occlusion can also be pre - baked , as it is in games such as Team Fortress 2 . ----- Extra 3 ; The latest way to do shadows is * * voxel cone tracing * * where we convert the light data of the world into a voxel representation and trace between voxels to illuminate objects , rather than to cast shadows . This technique was developed for real - time global - illumination but it also works for calculating shadows . This technique is really good as it produces incredibly accurate shadows depending on voxel resolution and scales very nicely , but the draw - back is that it is difficult to implement as most of the algorithm is too slow to run on a CPU but runs very nicely across the many GPU cores , so CUDA or OpenCL is used . The was a technique developed before the XBone / PS4 consoles were announced and it was running very well on PC hardware of the time , Unreal Engine 4 even adopted the technique pretty much the moment it had a white paper published , however the XBone and PS4 specs were announced and both consoles are significantly weaker than we all thought they would be , so this technique has been retired early and will probably reappear in the next generation of consoles . ----- Extra 4 ; Some people are discussing * * blob shadows * * , which are n't intensive at all and are relatively cheap . There 's many ways to do a blob shadow , usually it is done by just having a square at the feet of objects with a blob texture on it , but the problem with this is that the shadow floats in the air if you are standing on the edge of geometry . The best way is to grab information about the intersecting terrain of the shadow , generate a new mesh that overlays on that terrain and apply a decal texture of a blob shadow . Super Mario 64 uses a neat trick where the blob shadow is on a circular mesh that is split into pie - like sections , when a section hangs over the edge of a surface it is made invisible , this is a good mix between the first technique of blob shadows and the second technique . Another form of shadows similar to blob is to flatten the objects at their base and render them to a colour buffer with no transparency and a black colour , then this shadow buffer can be made semi - transparent and drawn over the final colour buffer ( with some depth testing ) to get some simple shadows - at - the - feet of objects , but again they will hang over geometry , which is where the clipping is needed .","The reason why shadows is expensive to calculate is because shadows have to take into consideration how objects affect themselves and other objects . Other basic 3D rendering techniques ( lighting , texturing ) deal with objects in a scene independent of other objects ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Rendering shadows in video games can be challenging because it requires the computer to calculate how the light in the virtual environment should interact with the objects in the scene.

If the wind is coming from behind , or at not too big an angle behind , the boat , then the sail is trimmed ( basically , aimed ) so that the wind fills the sail from behind . The wind pushes the boat along , as you 'd expect . If the boat were to reach the speed of the wind , any further increase in the boat 's speed would cause the wind to start pushing it * back * . So , in that configuration , the boat ca n't go faster than the wind . 2 . Once the wind is more than about 45 degrees off from the stern ( rear ) of the boat , though , the sail is trimmed such that the * front edge * of the sail is pointing into the wind . The wind is now flowing * along * the sail on both sides of it . As the boat turns further and further towards the wind , the sail gets pulled in further and further , so that its front edge is aimed into the wind and the wind is flowing along both sides . This works until the boat is heading about 45 degrees upwind - that is , the wind is coming in at a 45 degree angle off the bow ( front ) of the boat . How the sail works in this case , I 'll explain a bit further down . 3 . When the boat is pointing closer than 45 degrees into the wind , that will stop working . You can no longer get the right sail shape , and the wind will just push against the boat and slow it down and eventually stop it . So the people in other comments saying you can sail almost directly upwind are mistaken . You ca n't practically sail very close to directly upwind , you have to be a significant angle off . This is why , when boats are trying to get directly upwind , you 'll see the zigzag , and you 'll notice each zig and zag is approximately a 90 degree turn - because they 're close to 45 degrees off the wind in one direction , and then the other , as they work their way upwind . So , how does the sail work when the boat is pointing somewhere between about 45 degrees upwind and 45 degrees downwind ? It 's all about the shape of the sail . Imagine yourself looking down on the boat from directly above the mast . The wind is blowing the sail into a sort of billow form . If it could , the wind would blow the sail all the way straight in whatever direction the wind is going , like a flag , but it ca n't . A sail is not like a flag in a very important way - the bottom of it is attached to a big straight bar , called the boom . So the sail must stay straight at the bottom , all the way to the rear corner . But , and this is just as important , the sail is n't a plain flat triangle either . It has a bunch of extra fabric ; it 's bigger in the middle than is needed to fill the space between the lines if it were just flat . So there 's extra material to billow out , and the wind , trying to blow the sail off to the side , turns it into a curve . Because of the shape of the sail and how much extra material is in which parts , the sail forms a shape with a sharper ballooning out right at the front , and a shallower curve towards the rear . If you 're looking at this from above , this shape looks very much like what the cross - section of an airplane wing looks like from the side . It works in the same way . I 'm not going to fully ELI5 how that works right here , but the simplest way to imagine it is that the wind creates * suction * on the rear side of the sail . Think of it like this , sort of : Along the inside of the sail 's curve , the side in the direction the wind is coming from , the wind is directly hitting the sail and being curved by it . So here , the wind is partly pushing against the sail . But on the outside of the sail 's curve , the side away from the direction the wind is coming from , the wind going past the mast would just keep on moving past where the sail is , except that direction of motion of the air would pull some air away from the sail . It causes the wind to curve in towards the sail after it has passed it , but it 's not actually blowing against the sail , it 's still blowing kind of away from the sail . It 's pulling air away from the sail . It 's creating a kind of suction , sucking the sail in that direction . It 's pulling the sail towards the direction in which it 's billowing . Now , you might 've noticing , looking down at the boat from above , that this direction the wind is sucking the sail towards is n't actually directly towards the front of the boat . And you 're right - if the boat were flat on the bottom , it would start sliding partly sideways , partly forward . But sailboats have something called a keel ( if it 's permanently fixed ) or centerboard ( if it 's made to slide into and out of the water ) , which sticks out from the bottom of the boat deep into the water . This keel is a thing but wide blade shape that allows the boat to easily slide forward or backward , but presents a lot of resistance against sliding sideways . So all of the sideways component of the force coming from the sail gets wasted pushing water against the side of the keel / centerboard , but the forward component of the force from the sail moves the boat forward . Even though the boat is actually being pushed at an angle sideways - forward , it only moves forward . Now here 's the most important part for answering your question : This motion of the wind along the sail on both sides , creating a force that sucks the sail towards where it 's billowing ... this force is going to keep on being there as long as the wind is flowing along the sail . It does n't matter how fast the boat is moving . This force is stronger when the wind is faster , and this force weakens when the wind is slower , but this force is not affected at all by how fast the boat is moving ! It 's the same amount of suction - force on a boat standing still , or on a boat slowly , or a boat moving fast . If the boat happens to be moving at a speed that happens to be higher than the speed of the wind ? So what ? There 's no relationship , per se , between the speed of the wind and the speed of the boat in that sense . The only relationship is that the speed of the wind determines how much suction - force acceleration is being applied to the boat . In theory , this could eventually accelerate the boat to \" infinite \" speed ( well , eventually relativity and speed of light limitations start to matter :) , as long as the wind kept flowing along the sides of the sail like that . It does n't , of course , because there 's drag on the boat . That is , resistance to its forward motion , mainly from the water , though somewhat from air too . For any specific amount of forward suction - force , there 's a maximum speed it can get the boat to , where the amount of force from water and air resistance is equal to amount of forward force from the sail 's suction , and the boat stops getting any faster . Obviously , the stronger the wind , the faster the boat can go before reaching that point , because the stronger the wind , the stronger the suction - force from the sail . But the point is , that maximum speed is * not * determined by a comparison of the boat 's speed and the wind 's speed . Rather , it 's determined by the relationship between the amount of suction - force you can get from that particular size & shape of sail at whatever the current speed of the wind is , vs. the amount of resistance on the boat ( determined by its mass and design ) . Of course skill matters too , because the boat wo n't actually get the true maximum force from the sail . How close it is to the maximum possible , depends on how well the sailors trim the sail to just the right point , and keep up with changes in wind direction , with a combination of subtly steering the boat and moving the sail in or out ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Sailboats can go faster than the wind because they use the wind to propel themselves through the water. The wind pushes against the sails, which causes the boat to move forward. \nImagine you are holding a piece of paper in your hand and you blow on it. The paper will move in the direction that you are blowing. Now imagine you are holding a cardboard box in your hand and you blow on it. The box will not move as easily as the paper because it is much heavier and more difficult to push. \nSailboats work in a similar way. The wind pushes against the sails, but the boat is much heavier than the paper, so it doesn't move as easily. However, the shape of the sails is designed to catch the wind and use its energy to propel the boat forward. The keel, which is a long, heavy fin that extends from the bottom of the boat, helps to keep the boat upright and moving in a straight line. \nSo, to summarize, sailboats go faster than the wind because they use the wind to propel themselves through the water.

{"question":"The logic behind raising taxes for the poor and cutting them for the rich ? Thanks for the answers ! It makes a lot more sense now . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The logic , albeit flawed , is that the \" poor \" ( who generally work for the \" rich \" ) do n't pay their fair share ( to an extent this is true ) , and that reducing taxes on the rich encourages them to invest it into things that create jobs for the poor . The idea is that by making the rich richer , wealth will \" trickle down \" to the poor . Hence the phrase \" trickle down economics . \" This has been shown to not actually work in real life . The only reason the rich are rich is because the poor ( the vast majority of the population , and therefore the vast majority of customers ) have money to spend on things that the rich make and sell . Further , when you consider that the poor SPEND most of their income , and the rich either hoard or invest it , it makes sense to use higher taxes to lift the tax burden off the poor so the economy can keep running . It also makes sense to use taxes to encourage the rich to invest their money into companies that build things and employ people instead of investing it into things that turn money into more money for no real work ( buying real estate , stocks , bonds ) , or worse , hoarding it in trust funds and offshore bank accounts ( often to avoid paying taxes on it ) . Yes , the richest people often pay more in taxes than the poor make in a year . BUT , when you consider that the rich are only rich because of the infrastructure that our tax dollars built it 's only fair that they pay a larger share . If there was no public education system , you would n't have any skilled workers to make your money with . If there were no roads you would n't be able to ship your goods far enough to become as rich as you are . In the end , the rich will end up paying a smaller portion ( if not a smaller amount ) of their income in taxes because of tax loopholes ( ie , because the capital gains tax is a lower percentage than income tax , and much of their income is from investments ) and because they spend less of their income , meaning less of their income goes to sales taxes and excise taxes . This is why Monaco , despite having an 18 % tax rate , is considered a tax haven . The poor end up paying a vastly higher effective tax rate ( assuming they spend 60 % of their income , they would be paying 10.8 % in taxes ) than the rich ( who , assuming they spend 10 % of the income , would be paying 1.8 % in tax ) .

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["[ Long version of what is a hedge fund ] ( URL_0 ) Short version : there 's no real definition of what a hedge fund is , but the rough consensus is that it 's when rich investors pool their investment money together and use aggressive investment strategies to maximize the returns of the investments . Most well known being borrowing a lot of money from banks , several times what the total amount of money in the fund , as a way to amplify the strength of the investment money . But most hedge funds are secretive and do n't openly declare their strategies , to prevent competition . One of the key reasons why they are able to succeed with high returns is because they are unregulated , and can do crazy risky things that other funds ca n't . And they are unregulated because it 's assumed only crazy rich people who do n't mind losing their money would touch hedge funds .","Imagine a private mutual fund that hides their strategies for investment That 's a hedge fund , and they hide their strategies because the market is efficient and if they 've found a model that actually beats the market , that is a secret worth keeping","A hedge fund is an investment fund that uses hedging instruments to seek outsized returns . Hedging instruments are instruments that can be used to lower your risk . For example , if you are a farmer and you know you will produce 100 gallons of milk per day for the next year , you can pre - sell that milk on a futures or forwards market , thereby reducing your risk . This is called hedging . On the other side of your hedge might be a cheese manufacturer who wants to guarantee their input costs and therefore also hedge using futures contracts . Unfortunately , the amount of people who need to hedge do n't perfectly balance out . In come the speculators . These speculators take the other side of the deal allowing the counter - party to hedge . What 's more , the speculator is seeking a return while the hedger is seeking a guarantee , so often the speculator demands a price that favours them , allowing them to earn outsized returns . In this example , if we expect milk to sell at $ 100 next year , the farmer might be happy to lock in a price of $ 98 , which would give the speculator an expected $ 2 gain . In reality , they might end up owing $ 10 if the price ends up at $ 88 , but on average , they trade a good return for the farmer 's security . What 's more , the Hedge fund does n't have to put much money down to buy this contract , since all they are doing is making a promise to pay in the future . Futures , forwards , options , and leverage ( borrowing ) are the typical tools Hedge Funds use to speculate on the market and get exaggerated returns . Hedge funds buy or sell these in combination with the underlying asset ( in this example , milk , but more commonly , stocks or index funds ) to exaggerate the moves in the market . If they correctly bet on an asset increasing in value , they can get more than 10x the market return of simply buying the asset . Conversely , they can also fail miserably . They are high risk and for this reason , you are n't supposed to invest in them unless you are an accredited investor . We tend to believe that they are extremely successful because of survivorship bias . For example , if you look at any hedge fund that exists today and you ask how much they made over the last ten years , almost all of them did extremely well . The reason of course is that the hedge funds that did badly over the recession no longer exist and wo n't be part of your database . Hedge funds fail more frequently than any other kind of fund but also can give better returns than any other kind of fund when they succeed ."],"chatgpt_answers":["A hedge fund is a type of investment fund that uses various strategies to earn a profit.

However, they also carry a higher level of risk than some other types of investments, so it's important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before investing in a hedge fund. \nTo start a hedge fund, a person or group of people typically need to have a lot of knowledge and experience in finance and investing.

However , that 's not really an ELI5 answer , but in this TED talk ( URL_0 ) Andrew Solomon discusses depression in a way that I think anybody can relate to . In specific relation to this question , he says that Depression can not simply be described as \" sadness \" , but rather , \" much too much sadness , at far too slight a cause \" . He also brings up situations that sometimes get incorrectly labelled as \" depression \" . For instance , if a loved one passes away , and you feel deep sadness for several weeks , it may be hard to separate that feeling from the experience of depression , but if you can manage to function normally after a few weeks ( and by that I mean , you can get out of bed , you can take care of yourself , attend to your daily activities , not that you suddenly feel perfectly contented ) , then it 's likely a period of grief that you 're experiencing , and it will ultimately resolve itself . However , if you experience a loss and find yourself utterly in despair for months and can not manage to function at all then it 's more likely that the event triggered a depression and that you should seek treatment to resolve it , because it may not resolve itself normatively . I know this is n't exactly the most crystal clear difference , but the point is that the difference between sadness and depression is not necessarily the depth of the feeling . Some people find themselves very sad at times , but as a reaction to equally dismal experiences , but that is not mental illness .

Military aircraft: Many countries also have military aircraft that are specifically designed to patrol their airspace and protect against unauthorized intrusions. These aircraft can intercept and investigate any aircraft that appears to be behaving suspiciously. \n4. International agreements: There are also international agreements in place that outline the rules for aircraft entering another country's airspace. For example, if an aircraft wants to enter another country's airspace, it must first request permission and provide information about its intended flight path and the type of aircraft it is. If the request is not granted, the aircraft is not allowed to enter the airspace. \nOverall, there are many measures in place to prevent planes from impersonating other airplanes and entering a country's airspace without proper authorization."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Airplanes have unique codes called transponder codes that identify the plane to air traffic control and other planes in the sky.

However, it's true that some Republicans do reject certain scientific concepts or findings, such as evolution and climate change. \nOne reason why some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts is that they may have religious or ideological beliefs that conflict with the scientific evidence. For example, some people might believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old, which conflicts with the scientific evidence that the Earth is billions of years old. Similarly, some people might believe that humans have a special place in the universe and are not subject to the same natural laws that apply to other living things, which conflicts with the scientific evidence for evolution. \nAnother reason why some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts is that they may be skeptical of the scientific method and the ways in which scientists arrive at their conclusions. Some people might believe that scientists are biased or that the scientific process is flawed in some way, and therefore they might be more likely to reject scientific findings that they disagree with. \nIt's also worth noting that some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts because they are misinformed about them or because they have been exposed to misinformation about them. For example, some people might believe that climate change is not real because they have heard false or misleading information about it. \nIn short, there are many different reasons why some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts.

Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before and after your jog. This will help keep your throat moist, which can reduce irritation. \n3. Try to breathe through your nose instead of your mouth. Your nose has tiny hairs called cilia that help filter out irritants, so breathing through your nose can help protect your throat. \n4. Take breaks to warm up and drink something warm, like tea or broth. This can help soothe your throat and keep it from getting too dry or irritated. \n5.

This trapped air helps to insulate the body and prevent heat loss. The armpits are also a common place for sweat glands, which produce a salty liquid called sweat. The hair in the armpits helps to keep the sweat close to the skin, where it can evaporate and help to cool the body down. \nThe hair in the pubic region serves a similar purpose, in that it helps to regulate body temperature by trapping a layer of air close to the skin.

{"question":"Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .","HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there .","There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts ."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few reasons why we still have SD (standard definition) TV channels: \n1.

HD channels take up more bandwidth than SD channels, so it's not possible to have as many HD channels as we have SD channels. This means that if we only had HD channels, some channels might not be available. \n3. HD channels also require more expensive equipment to produce, so some TV stations might not be able to afford to upgrade to HD. \nOverall, it's important to have both SD and HD channels so that everyone can watch TV, regardless of what kind of TV they have or how much money they have."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Well, some people still have old TVs that can only show SD videos.

{"question":"magic the gathering What is it . how popular is it . who plays it . The culture behind it .. etc . etc I have been hearing more and more about it , and after last nights South Park episode I became curious what it is .. Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent 's turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it 's not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n't stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n't stay ahead of the enemy 's attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they 're designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n't get the combo out in time or ca n't protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n't get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro'd ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you 're playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it 's a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player 's personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n't win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder 's toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones .

( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I 'm planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I 'll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .","Magic was invented , I want to say around 1994 , and was the first playable trading card game of its kind . Its format inspired more mainstream games , like Pokemon and Yugioh . I personally have known players as young as 8 or 9 , and as old as people in their 30 's and 40 's . Basically , the premise is that you 're a wizard fighting other wizards using magic spells . These spells are powered by a type of energy called mana , which is typically drawn from land . These spells can be used to summon creatures to fight for you , to help you and your creatures , or to harm your opponent and his creatures . Each player starts with 20 life points , and typically loses when they are reduced to 0 life points . There are five colors of mana , which represent the fundamental themes of the game . White represents order and justice , green represents nature and strength , red represents war and chaos , black represents death and self destruction , blue represents illusion and deception .","Something that I find helps understand the game a great deal : Richard Garfield , pHD made the game as an economics paper . He wanted to see how people allocate resources , but also loved Dungeons and Dragons . If you look at the first set , you have your initial creatures of each color as an Angel ( W ) , Dragon ( R ) , Wurm ( G ) , Djinn ( U ) and Vampire ( B ) . The mana sources were played once a turn , and how you used it mattered . You could use your one mana to play a creature , or allocate those resources towards something else . You could destroy someone 's ability to produce resources . You can avoid creatures ( monsters ) all together . As the game progressed , it branched out greatly from basic D & D. Now we have entire sets of cards dedicated to a single mythos . We had 2013 as a Greek mythology themed sets , complete with gods interacting with mortals , two years before that we had a whole set of gothic horror complete with werewolves , giests and families of elitist vampires . The game has thousands of cards , some extremely valuable , some not , but it all started to see if we could attach some modicum of economics to D & D."],"chatgpt_answers":["Magic: The Gathering is a collectible card game that was first published in 1993.

Cost: While it may seem like it would be cheaper to film on location, this is not always the case.

Additionally, the filmmakers may need to pay to use certain locations, or they may have to pay to have the location altered in some way to suit their needs. \n3. Logistics: Filming on location can also be logistically challenging. The filmmakers may need to deal with crowds, noise, and other distractions, which can make it difficult to get the shots they need. Additionally, the filmmakers may not have access to all of the resources they need on location, such as electricity, water, or special equipment. \n4. Safety: Finally, building a set can be safer for the cast and crew. Filming on location can involve dealing with hazards such as traffic, unstable terrain, or inclement weather. By building a set, the filmmakers can create a controlled environment where these hazards are minimized. \nOverall, building sets can be more expensive upfront, but it can also be more cost-effective in the long run, as it allows the filmmakers to have greater control over their shooting environment and reduce the risk of delays or unexpected costs."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Movie companies build sets because it gives them greater control over the filming environment.

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)","Tor is an encryption system that bounces your data between dozens of computers around the world , each computer unravelling one layer of encryption that tells it who to send it to next , to make it tough to trace . Each one of those computers is a node , and the one at the end of the chain - where your data hits the rest of the internet - is an exit node .","TOR is a routing system and stands for ' The Onion Router ' because it works in layers , just like an ogre or an onion . A TOR node is a node that participates in a TOR network , i.e. a server somewhere on the planet . The exit node is just the last node in a given configuration , i.e. the node just before the server you want to reach . TOR is used to hide the identity of the user . TOR works like this : you take your message and encrypt it with multiple encryption algorithms - one for every TOR node you want to route through . Thus layers . You do it in the following order : the most outer layer is encrypted so the the very first TOR node and only the very first TOR node can decipher it . The second outer layer is encrypted so the the second TOR route can decipher it and so on , and the last layer is encrypted so that the exit node can decipher it . This means that if you send your message to the first node he gets rid of the most outer layer . The message is still scrambled and unreadable because there are still as many encryption layers as there are TOR routes left . Now , provided you use end - to - end encryption on top of using TOR this system becomes pretty good at hiding your identity because for every single node in the configuration the node only knows where any given message came from and where it has to go . It does n't know if it 's the first one that got the message or the last one and it does n't know what 's written in it .

The question is how much will be available- only when the size of the interest payments become too great will it cause any noticeable effect on the economy , because services will have to be cut or taxes increased . Given our historical growth rate , most people think we could have debt growth of about 3 % per year ( ~480 billion ) and never reach this point , because the growth in the economy via inflation , population growth and true growth allows the economy to expand to meet the increased debt levels . Since our current deficit is at around this level , there is virtually nothing to get concerned about .

This means that it would not be able to make the required payments to its lenders and could potentially lead to financial problems for the country. \nIt's important for countries to try to pay off their debts, but it's not always possible to do it all at once. Instead, they might make a plan to gradually pay off their debts over time. This is called a debt repayment plan. \nIn the case of the United States, the government has a lot of debt, but it also has a strong economy and is able to borrow money at low interest rates.

For every criminal profile that is right there is usually one that is wrong . The efficacy of criminal profiling is hotly debated .

The degree to which these profiles are accurate tends to increase with the number of data - points ( e.g. crime scenes ) that the profiler has to work with ( i.e. that are believed to be linked to the same offender ) . Profiling specific details ( e.g. a particular car model ) can not be done with any sort of accuracy unless the profiler has additional information ( e.g. physical evidence or eye - witness accounts ) which leads him / her to make such a conclusion . It is possible , however , that certain evidence may lead the profiler to suspect the criminal drives a certain type of vehicle . For example , evidence may suggest that the crime was politically motivated and the offender is an environmental protection activist . It may therefore be predicted that the offender drives an environmentally friendly electric / hybrid car . If , on the other hand , the criminal is suspected of being a hunter and weapons enthusiast , it may be predicted that he drives a utility truck of some sort which has lots of storage space . Criminal Profiling is still a hotly debated topic in Forensic Psychology because - although many profiles do turn out to be quite accurate - there are many criminals who are eventually caught and do n't end - up matching the predicted profile . The forensic utility of profiling is still questioned and it 's important for people to realize that these profiles are merely educated guesses and law enforcement should not eliminate or ignore suspects who do n't fit the suspected profile . Source : Degree in Psychology & Criminology .","Most of the traditional \" real - life \" FBI profiles are more demographic - based than psychology - based . That is , they figured out that most rapists and other predatory sexual criminals started at around X age , grew more criminally sophisticated ( and often more violent ) as they committed more crimes , had certain types of experiences and behaviors in their background ( abuse , neglect , voyeuristic behavior , violence toward animals ) , etc . Based on that data they 're able to predict certain things about an offender with a certain degree of accuracy : age ( or at least experience level ) , race -- since most sexual criminals tend to victimize those of their own race -- background / living situation , and so on . In addition , there are certain other things that are more specific .

If I were to do it myself to get it back running and make the company more profitable I would be fined or fired for taking work from another worker 's \" craft \" and violating the union contract .","A union is essentially a representative that sits between you and your employer when it comes to matters such as hiring ( workplace agreements and wages ) , termination ( fair dismissal , severance ) , strikes and so on . For workers unions are usually a good thing , because the union represents a large number of people in an industry they 're in a good position to negotiate better wages and working conditions than any individual would be able to get . The union will also represent you in workplace disputes , and can sometimes provide legal representation . Unions do have some downsides . For example if there are non - unioned workers in an industry it effectively weakens the union 's position ( why would an employer agree to the union 's demands when they can just hire non - union people instead ) . Therefore in some industries there is a lot of pressure on workers to join unions . If you look around you 'll find stories of strong - arm tactics or even open hostility . Employers also find unions difficult to work with . An employer needs to consider the financial situation of their company when considering things like wages , the union does n't have the same concern and so could make demands greater than the employer can cover , if the employer does n't meet the demands or negotiate them down then they risk their staff going on strike . The pro - union counterargument is that without unions the employers will have minimal pressure to actually raise wages , and that factors such as workplace favouritism could end up with two employees doing the same work for different amounts of pay , therefore it is better to have the employer and the union negotiate the wage for everyone ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Unions are organizations that workers can join to advocate for better working conditions, wages, and benefits. Some people believe that unions are important because they help workers have a stronger voice in the workplace and can help improve the lives of workers.

How can an attacker deanonymize a victim using this procedure ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The news article you posted does n't do a great deal of explaining , but the [ published paper ] ( URL_0 ;) is quite useful . Particularly , the attack summarised through the following steps : 1 ) Client downloads a file from the server that colludes with the adversary . 2 ) While the download progresses , the server injects a repeating traffic pattern in the TCP connection it sees originating from the exit node . 3 ) After sometime the download process is stopped and the server halts the traffic shaping procedure . 4 ) The adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server to exit traffic and for the various clients that used the victim entry node for the duration of the attack experiment . 5 ) If the flows are not correctly aligned , equally long and evenly separated , then the adversary applies the approximation strategy to correctly align them . 6 ) The adversary thereafter computes correlation coefficient for the server to exit traffic network statistics and for all the individual clients that used the victim entry node during the attack experiment . 7 ) The victim client ’s statistics is expected to be most correlated to the server to exit node traffic . Thus the client , whose traffic statistics are most correlated to the exit node traffic are chosen as the victim and verified . Basically , if the NSA controlled a service you were trying to access via Tor , they could send specially shaped packets to act as a sort of label . Even though the data is encrypted and anonymised through Tor ( between the entry and exit nodes ) , if the NSA controlled a lot of routers or major Internet exchange points , they could still track the special packets from the server to the first exit - node , through the middlemen , and finally ( and imperatively ) back through the original entry node & back to your original connection . But that 's not nearly ELI5 enough so I 'll do a * really simplified * analogy which gets the idea across : * * TL;DR * * - say Tor was n't actually an Internet thing and instead was a way of anonymously sending physical mail . If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here . Theoretically yes Tor is vulnerable but this paper does n't prove it can actually be exploited in any meaningful manner to intercept communications between two end users that want to remain anonymous .","Let me start with this I'M NOT A LAWYER OR AN IT PROFESSIONAL Now that we got that out of the way .

A third choice is to cruise near nautical choke points like between islands or outside sandbars . Large convoys of vessels also usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a good deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing .

{"question":"The differences between flash and HTML5 Which one is better for me as a user ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["They are really quite different . HTML is the language that websites are written in . It describes what elements are in the page and how they 're organized ( elements such as text , images , buttons and links ) . However , HTML originally did n't include the ability to show graphics , animations or videos ( other than pre - rendered images and animated gifs ) . HTML did provide the ability to include embedded objects , which would require the user to install a plugin that could display them . One such common plugin was Flash , which was basically another small program that runs inside your browser ( another such plugin is Java which can display Java Applets , but they 're hardly in use anymore ) . So developers could use Flash to create things like games ( such as the ones you 'll find in URL_0 ) and video players ( such as YouTube ) . HTML5 introduces new features to HTML , mainly the support for the < canvas > and < video > elements . These tags could be used to display graphics and videos without the need for an external plugin , and were handled by the browser and not by the plugin . HTML5 introduces many other new features , but these are the ones that are most relevant to this discussion ( HTML5 vs Flash ) . The main advantage of HTML5 is that it 's a standard that 's supported ( or should be supported ) by every browser . On the contrary , Flash is no longer supported by Apple 's devices , and by Android 's stock browser . Another disadvantage of Flash is that it 's considered slow and inefficient .","Essentially Flash is a product , whereas HTML5 is an open standard agreed upon by the internet 's \" governing body \" . Flash is a separate program that is run embedded within the browser , whereas HTML5 is a new version of the HTML markup language used to lay out web pages that is simply rendered by the browser natively . HTML5 is a W3C standard ( it is defined by the World - Wide - Web Committee , a group that defines common standards for Internet protocols and technologies ) whereas Flash is a proprietary product , owned by Adobe . IMO ( as a Solution Architect - a person who designs large scale software systems ) and former software engineer and web developer HTML5 is far superior . The open standard thing is important as it means that all vendors * should * implement the way they render it in the same way as opposed to Flash which requires you to download and keep updated an extra program as well as your browser . HTML5 is very capable in terms of animation and etc which * used to * require Flash ( or Microsoft Silverlight , a similar product ) and performs better in every case I have seen , although as it has only just been ratified as a standard I have n't yet seen any HTML5 games , for example . I 'm sure they 're out there though !","html5 works on mobile devices , flash does n't"],"chatgpt_answers":["Flash and HTML5 are both technologies that are used to create and display content on the internet. Flash is a software platform that was developed by Adobe and is used to create animations, games, and other interactive content. HTML5 is a version of the HTML programming language that is used to create the structure and layout of websites and web applications. \nAs a user, it's important to know that Flash and HTML5 are not directly competing technologies. They are simply two different ways of creating and displaying content on the internet, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. \nHere are some key differences between Flash and HTML5: \nCompatibility: Flash requires a separate plug-in to be installed in your web browser in order to work, while HTML5 is built into most modern browsers and does not require any additional software. This means that HTML5 content is generally more widely compatible and can be accessed on a wider range of devices, including smartphones and tablets.\nPerformance: HTML5 content tends to perform better than Flash content, especially on mobile devices. This is because HTML5 content is designed to be lightweight and efficient, while Flash content can be more resource-intensive and may not run as smoothly on some devices.\nSecurity: Flash has a reputation for being less secure than HTML5, as it is more susceptible to malware and other types of online threats. HTML5, on the other hand, has built-in security features that help to protect against these types of threats. \nUltimately, which technology is \"better\" for you as a user will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you need to access interactive content or games on the internet, then Flash may be a good option for you. If you are primarily interested in accessing static content (such as text and images) or using web-based applications, then HTML5 may be a better choice."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5","chatgpt_answers_with_SDE_prompt":"Hi!

{"question":"how is filibustering even a thing ? Why is filibustering even considered a valid tactic in politics ? Why is it simply not dismissed and does it have any practical uses ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Filibustering is a tactic that evolved in the Senate . It 's often called a \" parliamentary procedure , \" as it results not from constitutional law but the internal rules of the legislature . In order to allow time for a bill to be discussed and debated , a 60 vote majority is required to proceed from discussion to a vote . Senators realized they could exploit this rule to keep the majority from passing a bill , unless they had a 60 - vote majority ( a \" Fillibuster - proof majority . \" Filibusters used to require a significant investment of time . Senators grew weary of the pain of a filibuster , and today , the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to get a bill withdrawn due to the time involved ( [ Senators in the past were known to read recipes , Shakespeare , anything in sight ] ( URL_0 ) ) Now , to your questions : Why is it valid ? Because it works for the minority party . Why is it not simply dismissed ? No majority will eliminate it because they know it will be useful to them in the future . You 'll hear of the \" Nuclear Option \" from time to time , a threat to eliminate the filibuster by changing the rules ( by simple majority ) . So far , it has not happened . I would n't be surprised to see it happen in the next congress - the rise of use of filibuster is unprecedented ( the filibuster itself is less than 100 years old ) and scorched - earth politicking has become more and more common inside the beltway .

Ultimately the check on its use is in overuse -- if you use it too often , you and your party start to develop a bad name and lose even more seats .
